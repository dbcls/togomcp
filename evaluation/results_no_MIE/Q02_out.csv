14,2026-02-01,Structured Query,What are the most potent inhibitors of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)?,True,True,False,0.4375,"The most potent inhibitors of human EGFR include:

## **Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)**

**First Generation (reversible):**
- **Gefitinib** (Iressa) - IC50 ~2-5 nM
- **Erlotinib** (Tarceva) - IC50 ~2 nM
- These are relatively selective for EGFR

**Second Generation (irreversible):**
- **Afatinib** (Gilotrif) - IC50 ~0.5 nM, covalently binds to EGFR
- **Dacomitinib** - IC50 ~0.4-6 nM, pan-HER inhibitor
- **Neratinib** - irreversible pan-HER inhibitor

**Third Generation:**
- **Osimertinib** (Tagrisso) - IC50 ~12-15 nM for wild-type, but highly selective for T790M resistance mutation
- Designed to overcome resistance while sparing wild-type EGFR

## **Monoclonal Antibodies**
- **Cetuximab** (Erbitux) - Kd ~0.2 nM
- **Panitumumab** (Vectibix) - Kd ~0.05 nM

However, I can explain the general relationship:

**General Linking Between ChEMBL and PubChem:**

1. **Cross-references**: ChEMBL and PubChem maintain cross-reference mappings between their compound identifiers. These are typically based on chemical structure matching.

2. **Structure-based mapping**: Since both databases store chemical structures, compounds are linked when they represent the same molecular structure (usually based on InChI or InChIKey matching).

3. **Multiple mappings possible**: Sometimes one ChEMBL ID may map to multiple PubChem CIDs (Compound IDs) if there are different salt forms, stereoisomers, or representation variations.

- Query the ChEMBL database directly (which often includes PubChem cross-references in compound records)
- Use the PubChem Identifier Exchange Service
- Check the compound's page on either database's website

## Answer

The PubChem compound ID corresponding to **CHEMBL941** is **CID 5291** (or simply **5291**).

### About the Compound

Both identifiers refer to **Imatinib**, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug (marketed as Gleevec/Glivec) used to treat certain cancers including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).

**Key details:**
- **Molecular Formula:** C₂₉H₃₁N₇O
- **Molecular Weight:** 493.6 g/mol
- **IUPAC Name:** 4-[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-[(4-pyridin-3-ylpyrimidin-2-yl)amino]phenyl]benzamide

### How They Are Linked

ChEMBL and PubChem are linked through cross-reference mappings in several ways:

1. **Direct Database Cross-References:** Both databases maintain cross-reference tables that map compound identifiers between databases. The relationship is classified as ""**is nearly equivalent to**"" according to the TogoID ontology (TIO_000001).

2. **Chemical Structure Keys:** Both databases share the same structural identifiers for this compound:
   - **InChI Key:** This provides a standardized way to identify the same chemical structure across different databases
   - **SMILES notation:** Both databases contain the same SMILES representation

3. **ID Conversion Services:** Multiple bioinformatics services (like TogoID, which I used) provide ID conversion between ChEMBL and PubChem compound IDs, facilitating interoperability between these major chemical databases.

The relationship is ""nearly equivalent"" (rather than perfectly equivalent) because while they refer to the same chemical structure, the databases may contain different metadata, bioactivity data, or structural annotations specific to their curation processes.",,43.49041485786438,30,1499,18946,167231,"mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_molecule, mcp__togomcp__togoid_convertId, mcp__togomcp__togoid_getAllRelation, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__togoid_convertId, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__get_compound_attributes_from_pubchem","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_molecule"", ""input"": {""query"": ""CHEMBL941"", ""limit"": 5}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__togoid_convertId"", ""input"": {""ids"": ""CHEMBL941"", ""route"": ""chembl.compound,pubchem.compound"", ""limit"": 10}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__togoid_getAllRelation"", ""input"": {}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""chembl"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX chembl: <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/terms/chembl#>\nPREFIX cco: <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/terms/chembl#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?molecule ?pubchem_id\nWHERE {\n  ?molecule a chembl:SmallMolecule ;\n            chembl:chemblId \""CHEMBL941\"" ;\n            cco:hasDatabaseCrossReference ?xref .\n  ?xref cco:databaseSource \""PubChem\"" ;\n        cco:databaseReference ?pubchem_id .\n}""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__togoid_convertId"", ""input"": {""ids"": ""CHEMBL941"", ""route"": ""chembl_compound,pubchem_compound"", ""limit"": 10}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""chembl"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX chembl: <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/terms/chembl#>\nPREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?molecule ?label ?inchikey\nWHERE {\n  ?molecule a chembl:SmallMolecule ;\n            chembl:chemblId \""CHEMBL941\"" .\n  OPTIONAL { ?molecule skos:prefLabel ?label }\n  OPTIONAL { ?molecule chembl:inchikey ?inchikey }\n}\nLIMIT 10""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_compound_attributes_from_pubchem"", ""input"": {""pubchem_compound_id"": ""5291""}}]",CRITICAL,"PubChem CID 5291 (Imatinib), linked via cross-reference properties","COMPLEX QUERY requiring cross-reference knowledge.

## About Conflicting Interpretations in ClinVar

ClinVar tracks variants where different laboratories or submitters have provided **different clinical significance classifications**. These are common and occur when:

### Common Conflict Scenarios:

1. **Pathogenic vs. Benign conflicts** - The most significant type, where some labs classify a variant as disease-causing while others classify it as benign

2. **Pathogenic vs. VUS (Variant of Uncertain Significance)** - Disagreement about whether evidence is sufficient for a pathogenic classification

3. **Benign vs. VUS** - Disagreement about whether a variant can be confidently classified as benign

4. **Different levels within categories** - e.g., ""Pathogenic"" vs. ""Likely Pathogenic""

### Why Conflicts Occur:

- Different evidence available to different labs
- Different interpretation criteria or guidelines
- Timing (older vs. newer submissions)
- Different patient populations studied
- Variant-level vs. condition-specific interpretations

### In ClinVar:

- These variants are flagged with **aggregate germline classification** showing conflicts
- ClinVar provides a ""review status"" with stars (0-4) indicating agreement level
- Individual submissions from each lab are viewable

To find specific current examples, you would need to search the ClinVar database directly using their web interface or API, filtering for variants with conflicting interpretations.",,10.558539867401123,52,351,True,False,0.2857142857142857,"Based on my search of the ClinVar database, I found **over 230,000 variants** that have conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity from different laboratories. Here are some notable examples:

## Examples of Variants with Conflicting Interpretations:

### 1. **BRCA2 c.950C>A (p.Thr317Lys)** - VCV001767210
- **Location**: Chromosome 13, BRCA2 gene
- **Status**: ""Conflicting classifications of pathogenicity""

### 2. **SLC6A8 c.617G>A (p.Arg206His)** - VCV002181706
- **Location**: Chromosome X, SLC6A8 gene
- **Current classification**: Uncertain significance
- **Associated with**: Creatine transporter deficiency
- **Review status**: Reviewed by expert panel (FDA-recognized)
- **4 submitting laboratories** with varying opinions
- **Rare variant**: Allele frequency ~0.00002-0.00003 in population databases

### 3. **DYRK1B c.1285G>C (p.Gly429Arg)** - VCV001803906
- **Location**: Chromosome 19, DYRK1B gene
- **Status**: Uncertain significance
- **Associated with**: Abdominal obesity-metabolic syndrome and genetic diseases
- **4 different submitters** with no consensus yet

## Key Statistics:

- **Total variants with ""conflicting interpretations""**: ~1,366 specifically labeled
- **Total variants with conflicting pathogenicity assessments**: ~230,665
- These conflicts arise because different laboratories may:
  - Use different classification criteria
  - Have access to different patient/functional data
  - Weight evidence differently
  - Apply different versions of classification guidelines (e.g., ACMG)

## Why Conflicts Occur:

1. **Limited evidence**: Rare variants may have insufficient functional or segregation data
2. **Different evidence**: Labs may have access to different patient cohorts or functional studies
3. **Interpretation differences**: The same evidence can be weighted differently
4. **Evolving knowledge**: As more data accumulates, interpretations can change

22,2026-02-01,Currency,Which Reactome pathways have been associated with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing mechanisms?,True,False,True,0.5,"I don't have specific information about Reactome pathways that have been formally associated with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing mechanisms in my training data.

However, I can provide some context about what would be relevant:

CRISPR-Cas9 is a bacterial adaptive immune system that has been repurposed as a gene editing tool. When considering pathways that might be associated with CRISPR-Cas9 mechanisms, we would typically look at:

1. **DNA Repair Pathways** - particularly relevant since CRISPR-Cas9 creates double-strand breaks (DSBs):
   - Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)
   - Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)
   - Base Excision Repair (BER)

2. **DNA Damage Response pathways** - activated following Cas9-induced breaks

3. **Cell Cycle Checkpoints** - which may be triggered by DNA damage

Since CRISPR-Cas9 itself is not an endogenous human biological pathway but rather a molecular tool derived from bacteria, Reactome (which focuses on human biological pathways) wouldn't have a ""CRISPR-Cas9 pathway"" per se. Instead, it would contain the human cellular pathways that respond to or are affected by CRISPR-Cas9 activity.

To get accurate, up-to-date information about specific Reactome pathway identifiers associated with CRISPR-Cas9 research, you would need to query the Reactome database directly or check recent literature.",,8.20317792892456,60,361,True,True,0.625,"Based on my searches of the Reactome database, I found that **there are currently no specific pathways directly labeled as ""CRISPR-Cas9"" pathways** in Reactome. However, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing relies on fundamental DNA repair mechanisms that ARE extensively documented in Reactome.

## Key Pathways Associated with CRISPR-Cas9 Mechanisms:

CRISPR-Cas9 works by creating targeted double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, which are then repaired by the cell's endogenous DNA repair machinery. The relevant Reactome pathways include:

### 1. **DNA Double-Strand Break Repair** (R-HSA-5693532)
   - The overarching pathway for DSB repair mechanisms

### 2. **Nonhomologous End-Joining (NHEJ)** (R-HSA-5693571)
   - This is the primary repair pathway in most cell types
   - Often leads to insertions/deletions (indels) - used for gene knockouts
   - Involves proteins like Ku70/80, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, and DNA Ligase IV

### 3. **HDR through Homologous Recombination (HRR)** (R-HSA-5685942)
   - Used for precise gene editing when a repair template is provided
   - Involves proteins like RAD51, BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2
   - Active primarily in S/G2 phases of the cell cycle

### 4. **Processing of DNA Double-Strand Break Ends** (R-HSA-5693607)
   - Initial resection and processing of DSB ends
   - Critical for determining which repair pathway is used

These pathways represent the cellular machinery that CRISPR-Cas9 exploits for gene editing. The Cas9 enzyme creates the DSB, but it's these endogenous repair pathways that determine the editing outcome.",,40.153871059417725,23,1055,28588,120955,"mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing"", ""rows"": 30}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""CRISPR"", ""rows"": 30}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""Cas9"", ""rows"": 30}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""DNA double-strand break repair"", ""rows"": 30}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""homologous recombination"", ""rows"": 30}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""non-homologous end joining"", ""rows"": 30}}]",CRITICAL,"Pathways related to DNA repair, homologous recombination, and genome editing processes","SIMPLE QUERY - Straightforward pathway search.
