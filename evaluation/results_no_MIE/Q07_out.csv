- **Frequency**: 29-34% in Indian populations, but 70-80% in European populations
- **Type**: Three-nucleotide deletion (CTT) in exon 10
- **Effect**: Loss of phenylalanine at position 508, leading to:
  - Protein misfolding
  - Defective channel gating
  - Accelerated protein degradation
- **Clinical significance**: Pathogenic
- **Treatment**: Responsive to CFTR modulators like Ivacaftor

According to recent research from PubMed, this is the most extensively studied CFTR mutation. A 2025 computational study found that Ivacaftor binds favorably to F508del-mutant CFTR with binding energy of -7.45 kcal/mol ([DOI: 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2025.108865](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2025.108865)).

### 2. **Splicing Variants - TGnTm Repeats**
- **Location**: Affect exon 10 inclusion
- **Effect**: Disrupt normal mRNA splicing
- **Clinical significance**: Associated with monosymptomatic CF forms
- **Emerging treatment**: Small molecules like kinetin and RECTAS show promise in correcting these splicing defects ([DOI: 10.1016/j.jcf.2025.11.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2025.11.006))

## Other Pathogenic Variants

From the ClinVar database, here are examples of recently reported variants:

### Missense Variants:
- **p.Phe1164Leu** (c.3490T>C) - Uncertain significance
- **p.Pro988Ser** (c.2962C>T) - Uncertain significance
- **p.Arg697Thr** (c.2090G>C) - Uncertain significance
- **p.Leu1261Pro** (c.3782T>C) - Uncertain significance
- **p.Ala1374Pro** (c.4120G>C) - Uncertain significance
- **p.Glu535Gln** (c.1603G>C) - Uncertain significance
- **p.Pro1306Leu** (c.3917C>T) - Uncertain significance

### Other Variant Types:
- **Indels**: e.g., p.Ala1285Glu (c.3854_3855delinsAA)
- **Synonymous variants**: Some may still affect splicing (e.g., p.Cys343=, classified as likely benign)

## Geographic Variation

According to a comprehensive 2025 multicentric study from India involving 260 children (520 chromosomes), **105 different CFTR variants** were identified with significant regional variation ([DOI: 10.1016/j.gene.2025.149870](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2025.149870)):

- **Southern/Eastern India**: Genotypic spectrum similar to West/Southwest Asia
- **Northern/Western India**: Pattern resembles Western Europe
- Each region showed 4-5 common variants
- **14 novel variants** were discovered in this study alone

## Molecular Consequences

CFTR variants cause disease through several mechanisms:
1. **Missense variants** - Amino acid substitutions affecting protein function
2. **Deletions** - Loss of amino acids (like F508del)
3. **Splicing defects** - Abnormal mRNA processing
4. **Nonsense mutations** - Premature stop codons
5. **Frameshift mutations** - Insertion/deletion causing reading frame shifts

## Clinical Implications

The human CFTR protein (UniProt: P13569) functions as:
- An ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (subfamily C member 7)
- A cAMP-dependent chloride channel
- Channel conductance-controlling ATPase (EC 5.6.1.6)

Mutations disrupt chloride ion transport across epithelial membranes, leading to the multi-organ manifestations of cystic fibrosis.

## Summary

Cystic fibrosis shows remarkable genetic heterogeneity with thousands of disease-causing variants in the CFTR gene. While F508del remains the most common worldwide, the spectrum varies significantly by population. This genetic diversity has important implications for diagnosis, genetic counseling, and the development of targeted therapies like CFTR modulators.",,55.70551800727844,16,2207,20468,120113,"mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_ncbigene_entity, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esummary, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""CFTR cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator"", ""limit"": 5}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_ncbigene_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""CFTR human cystic fibrosis"", ""limit"": ""5""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch"", ""input"": {""database"": ""clinvar"", ""query"": ""CFTR[gene] AND cystic fibrosis"", ""max_results"": 20}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esummary"", ""input"": {""database"": ""clinvar"", ""ids"": [""4683093"", ""4652928"", ""4652059"", ""4651969"", ""4651878"", ""4651784"", ""4651695"", ""4651604"", ""4651520"", ""4651433""]}}, {""name"": ""mcp__pubmed__search_articles"", ""input"": {""query"": ""CFTR gene variants cystic fibrosis mutations"", ""max_results"": 10, ""sort"": ""pub_date""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch"", ""input"": {""database"": ""gene"", ""query"": ""CFTR[Gene Name] AND Homo sapiens[Organism]"", ""max_results"": 5}}, {""name"": ""mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata"", ""input"": {""pmids"": [""41447953"", ""41203217"", ""41242903""]}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch"", ""input"": {""database"": ""clinvar"", ""query"": ""CFTR[gene] AND F508del"", ""max_results"": 10}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch"", ""input"": {""database"": ""clinvar"", ""query"": ""CFTR[gene] AND (pathogenic OR likely pathogenic) AND cystic fibrosis"", ""max_results"": 20}}]",VALUABLE,CFTR variants including the common p.Phe508del (VCV000007105) and many other disease-associated variants,"COMPLEX QUERY requiring gene-disease association knowledge.

84,2026-02-01,Precision,What is the development phase of Osimertinib in ChEMBL?,True,False,False,0.3333333333333333,"I don't have access to real-time ChEMBL database information in my training data that would allow me to definitively state the current development phase of Osimertinib as recorded in ChEMBL.

However, I can tell you that Osimertinib (also known as Tagrisso, AZD9291) is a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been **approved by regulatory agencies** including the FDA (first approved in 2015, with expanded indications in 2018 and 2020) and EMA for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific EGFR mutations.

In ChEMBL, approved drugs are typically marked with a maximum phase of **""4"" (Approved)** in their development phase classification.

To get the exact current entry in ChEMBL, you would need to query the ChEMBL database directly or check the ChEMBL website for Osimertinib's compound page, where the development phase information is displayed.",,6.798950910568237,56,245,True,False,0.3333333333333333,"Based on the ChEMBL database, **Osimertinib (CHEMBL3353410) is in development phase 4**, which means it is an **approved drug**.

In ChEMBL, the development phases are classified as:
- Phase 0: Preclinical
- Phase 1-3: Clinical trials
- Phase 4: Approved for medical use

Osimertinib is indeed an FDA-approved medication used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific EGFR mutations, marketed under the brand name Tagrisso.",,18.432047128677368,15,444,849,78831,"mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_molecule, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_molecule"", ""input"": {""query"": ""Osimertinib"", ""limit"": 5}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""chembl"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX chembl: <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/terms/chembl#>\n\nSELECT ?molecule ?maxPhase\nWHERE {\n  ?molecule chembl:chemblId \""CHEMBL3353410\"" .\n  ?molecule chembl:highestDevelopmentPhase ?maxPhase .\n}""}}]",CRITICAL,Phase 4 (marketed/approved drug),"SIMPLE QUERY - Straightforward drug property lookup.
