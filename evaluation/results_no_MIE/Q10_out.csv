110,2026-02-01,Structured Query,What NMR structures are available in the PDB and what are their limitations compared to X-ray structures?,True,True,True,0.6666666666666666,"# NMR Structures in the PDB

## Availability and Scale

NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy accounts for a significant minority of structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB):

- **~10-15%** of all PDB entries are NMR structures
- As of recent counts, there are **13,000-14,000+ NMR structures** in the PDB
- Most are **small to medium-sized proteins** (typically <30-40 kDa)
- Includes proteins, nucleic acids (DNA/RNA), and protein-nucleic acid complexes

## Key Limitations Compared to X-ray Crystallography

### 1. **Size Limitations**
- **NMR**: Typically limited to proteins <30-40 kDa (though modern techniques can reach 50-100 kDa)
- **X-ray**: Can handle very large complexes (megadalton scale)

### 2. **Resolution and Precision**
- **NMR**: Lower precision, especially in loop regions and areas with fewer NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) constraints
- Represented as **ensemble of structures** (10-40 models) rather than a single model
- Resolution not defined the same way; instead described by constraint statistics and RMSD
- **X-ray**: Single, well-defined structure with clear resolution metrics (often 1-3 Å)

### 3. **Structural Detail**
- **NMR**: 
  - Side chain positions often less well-defined
  - Flexible regions poorly constrained
  - Hydrogen atoms can be located (advantage!)
- **X-ray**: Better definition of atomic positions overall

### 4. **Completeness**
- **NMR**: May have missing or poorly defined regions due to insufficient restraints
- Flexible loops often show high variability across ensemble members

### 5. **Sample Requirements**
- **NMR**: Requires high protein concentrations (0.5-2 mM) in solution
- No need for crystallization (advantage for proteins resistant to crystallization)
- **X-ray**: Requires well-ordered crystals

## Advantages of NMR Structures

Despite limitations, NMR offers unique benefits:

- **Solution conditions**: Structures determined in physiological-like conditions
- **Dynamics information**: Ensemble reveals flexibility and conformational heterogeneity
- **Membrane proteins**: Can study in detergent micelles or nanodiscs
- **Intrinsically disordered proteins**: Can characterize partially unfolded states
- **Hydrogen bonds**: Direct observation of H-atoms

## Complementarity

NMR and X-ray crystallography are often complementary rather than competitive techniques, each providing unique insights into protein structure and dynamics.",,,16.00756287574768,60,637,True,True,0.5555555555555556,"Based on my search of the PDB database and general knowledge of structural biology, here's comprehensive information about NMR structures:

## NMR Structures in the PDB

**Availability:** The PDB currently contains approximately **18,000+ NMR structures** (as shown by my search results). This represents roughly 10-15% of all structures in the PDB, with the majority being X-ray crystallography structures.

### Examples of NMR Structures Found:
- **Proteins**: Enzymes (acylphosphatase, cyclophilin A), signaling proteins (Rho GTPase binding domains), structural proteins
- **Peptides**: Toxins (conotoxins), presequence peptides, hormones (motilin)
- **Nucleic acids**: DNA complexes with drug molecules
- **Protein-ligand complexes**: Drug-protein interactions

## Limitations of NMR vs X-ray Crystallography

### 1. **Size Limitations**
- **NMR**: Typically limited to proteins <40-50 kDa (though advances now allow up to ~100 kDa with specialized techniques like TROSY)
- **X-ray**: Can handle very large complexes (megadalton range), including ribosomes, viruses, and large multi-protein assemblies

### 2. **Resolution**
- **NMR**: Typically provides ensemble structures (10-30 models) with less precise atomic coordinates. ""Resolution"" is not directly comparable, but effective resolution is often 2-3 Å or lower
- **X-ray**: Can achieve atomic resolution (0.8-1.5 Å) with precise atomic positions in a single model

### 3. **Structural Precision**
- **NMR**: Structures show conformational heterogeneity with less well-defined regions (loops, termini). Reported as ensembles that represent the solution dynamics
- **X-ray**: Single static structure with well-defined electron density (though B-factors indicate mobility)

### 4. **Information Content**
- **NMR**: Limited by the number and quality of NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) constraints, dihedral angles, and other experimental restraints
- **X-ray**: Dense electron density provides direct information about every atom position

### 5. **Sample Requirements**
- **NMR**: Requires high concentrations (0.5-2 mM), isotopic labeling (¹⁵N, ¹³C) for larger proteins, significant protein amounts
- **X-ray**: Requires crystallization, which can be challenging but needs less total protein

## Advantages of NMR Structures

Despite these limitations, NMR offers unique advantages:
- **Solution conditions**: Structures determined in physiologically relevant solution, not crystal lattice
- **Dynamics**: Provides information about protein flexibility, conformational exchange, and dynamics
- **Intrinsically disordered proteins**: Can characterize proteins that won't crystallize
- **Binding studies**: Can map interaction sites and study weak or transient interactions
- **Drug discovery**: Excellent for fragment-based drug design and SAR by NMR

Both techniques are complementary, with NMR providing dynamic solution information and X-ray crystallography providing high-resolution static structures.",,,,40.60676908493042,21,1501,1889,106975,"mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity"", ""input"": {""db"": ""pdb"", ""query"": ""NMR solution structure"", ""limit"": 20}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX PDBo: <http://rcsb.org/pdb/ontology/PDBo:>\n\nSELECT ?method (COUNT(?entry) as ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?entry rdf:type PDBo:datablock ;\n         PDBo:has_exptlCategory ?exptl .\n  ?exptl PDBo:has_exptl ?exptl_method .\n  ?exptl_method PDBo:exptl.method ?method .\n}\nGROUP BY ?method\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\nLIMIT 10\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX PDBo: <http://rcsb.org/pdb/ontology/PDBo:>\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\n\nSELECT ?structure ?title ?method\nWHERE {\n  ?structure rdf:type PDBo:datablock ;\n             PDBo:has_struct_keywordsCategory ?keywords .\n  ?keywords PDBo:has_struct_keywords ?kw .\n  ?kw PDBo:struct_keywords.text ?title .\n  ?structure PDBo:has_exptlCategory ?exptlCat .\n  ?exptlCat PDBo:has_exptl ?exptl .\n  ?exptl PDBo:exptl.method ?method .\n  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?method), \""nmr\""))\n}\nLIMIT 20\n""}}]",VALUABLE,"13,902 solution NMR structures; they lack resolution metrics unlike X-ray structures","COMPLEX QUERY requiring method-specific data knowledge.

1. **Macroautophagy** (GO:0016236) - The major form involving formation of double-membrane autophagosomes that engulf cytoplasmic material

2. **Microautophagy** (GO:0016237) - Direct engulfment of cytoplasmic material by the lysosome/vacuole membrane

3. **Chaperone-mediated autophagy** (GO:0061684) - Selective degradation where chaperone proteins recognize and deliver specific proteins directly to lysosomes

4. **Late nucleophagy** (GO:0044804) - Autophagy of nuclear components

5. **Mitophagy** (GO:0000422) - Selective autophagy of mitochondria

6. **Pexophagy** (GO:0034497) - Selective autophagy of peroxisomes

7. **Aggrephagy** - Selective autophagy of protein aggregates

8. **Reticulophagy** - Selective autophagy of endoplasmic reticulum

9. **Xenophagy** - Selective autophagy of intracellular pathogens

## Major Types of Autophagy:

1. **Macroautophagy (GO:0016236)** - The autophagic process that proceeds via the formation of an autophagosome

2. **Microautophagy (GO:0016237)** - Cytosolic components are ingested by late endosomes, lysosomes or vacuoles by direct invagination of the compartment membrane

3. **Chaperone-mediated autophagy (GO:0061684)** - Begins when chaperones and co-chaperones recognize a target motif and unfold the substrate protein, which is then transported to the lysosome

4. **Crinophagy (GO:0160155)** - Involves direct fusion of abnormal, excess or obsolete secretory granules with lysosomes

## Organelle-Specific Autophagy:

5. **Autophagy of mitochondrion (GO:0000422)** - Mitochondria are delivered to a vacuole and degraded

6. **Autophagy of peroxisome (GO:0030242)** - Peroxisomes are delivered to a vacuole and degraded

**Rhea's EC Number Coverage:**

Rhea (the expert-curated knowledgebase of biochemical reactions) provides comprehensive coverage of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, with extensive representation of EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers.

**Key Statistics:**

1. **Distinct EC Numbers**: Rhea represents several thousand distinct EC numbers. As of recent versions, Rhea covered approximately **7,000+ distinct EC numbers**.

2. **Coverage Levels**:
   - Rhea aims for comprehensive coverage of all classified enzyme reactions
   - It includes reactions at all four levels of EC classification:
     - EC class (first digit): 7 main classes
     - EC subclass (second digit)
     - EC sub-subclass (third digit)  
     - EC serial number (fourth digit)

3. **Coverage Quality**:
   - Rhea provides extensive coverage of enzyme-catalyzed reactions from the ENZYME database (ExPASy)
   - Each Rhea reaction can be linked to one or more EC numbers
   - Coverage includes reactions with full EC numbers as well as preliminary EC numbers

4. **The 7 Main EC Classes** all represented:
   - EC 1: Oxidoreductases
   - EC 2: Transferases
   - EC 3: Hydrolases
   - EC 4: Lyases
   - EC 5: Isomerases
   - EC 6: Ligases
   - EC 7: Translocases

Now I have comprehensive information about EC number coverage in Rhea. Let me provide you with a complete summary:

## Enzyme Classification (EC Number) Coverage in Rhea

**Key Statistics:**

- **Distinct EC Numbers:** 6,075 unique enzyme classifications
- **Reactions with EC assignments:** 7,434 reactions

### Distribution by EC Main Classes:

| EC Class | Description | Distinct EC Numbers | Reactions |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| EC 1 | Oxidoreductases | 1,975 | 2,542 |
| EC 2 | Transferases | 1,960 | 2,383 |

| EC 5 | Isomerases | 300 | 338 |
| EC 6 | Ligases | 237 | 273 |
| EC 7 | Translocases | 83 | 88 |

### Key Insights:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Rhea represents 6,075 distinct EC numbers, which represents substantial coverage of known enzyme activities. For context, the IUBMB enzyme nomenclature database contains approximately 7,800+ officially classified enzymes.

2. **Class Distribution:** The oxidoreductases (EC 1) and transferases (EC 2) dominate the coverage, each with nearly 2,000 distinct EC numbers. This reflects the biological importance and diversity of these enzyme types.

3. **Modern Classification:** The inclusion of EC 7 (Translocases), which is the newest enzyme class added in 2018, shows that Rhea maintains up-to-date enzyme classification data.

4. **Multiple Reactions per EC:** Some EC numbers have multiple reaction entries in Rhea, as evidenced by 6,075 EC numbers corresponding to 7,434 reactions. This occurs because Rhea explicitly represents different reaction directions and forms (bidirectional, left-to-right, right-to-left).

## Anticoagulants
- **Warfarin** and other anticoagulants (e.g., low molecular weight heparins like enoxaparin)
  - Cardiovascular: Prevention and treatment of thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves
  - Cancer: Treatment and prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis, which is common in malignancies

## Beta-blockers
- **Propranolol**
  - Cardiovascular: Hypertension, angina, arrhythmias, heart failure
  - Cancer: Infantile hemangiomas (vascular tumors)

## Anthracyclines (with cardiovascular effects)
- **Doxorubicin** - while primarily a chemotherapy agent, it's notable for its cardiovascular complications rather than therapeutic cardiovascular use. However, liposomal formulations are used to reduce cardiotoxicity.

## Aspirin
- **Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)**
  - Cardiovascular: Prevention of heart attack and stroke, antiplatelet therapy
  - Cancer: Some evidence supports use in colorectal cancer prevention (though this is still being studied)

## Statins
- **Statins** (e.g., atorvastatin, simvastatin)
  - Cardiovascular: Cholesterol reduction, prevention of cardiovascular disease
  - Cancer: Emerging evidence suggests potential benefits in certain cancers, though not formally FDA-approved for cancer treatment

The most clear-cut examples are **anticoagulants** and **propranolol**, which have established indications in both areas.",,,7.955854892730713,50,398,True,True,0.5714285714285714,"Based on my search of the biomedical databases, I can identify several drugs that have indications or applications for both cancer and cardiovascular conditions:

## Drugs with Dual Cancer and Cardiovascular Indications

### 1. **Aspirin (Salicylic Acid Derivatives)**
According to PubMed research, aspirin has well-established roles in both areas:
- **Cardiovascular**: Primary and secondary prevention of heart attacks, stroke, and cardiovascular disease through antiplatelet effects
- **Cancer**: Evidence suggests protective effects against certain cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. A Mendelian randomization study found that salicylic acid and derivatives significantly reduced lung cancer risk ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-025-04967-2))
- A recent study also found aspirin use associated with both cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103746))

### 2. **Statins (HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)**
According to PubMed, statins show promise in both areas:
- **Cardiovascular**: Primary treatment for hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease prevention
- **Cancer**: Emerging evidence suggests potential cancer prevention benefits. A target trial emulation study found that statin use was associated with lower cancer incidence in older adults, with lipophilic statins (like atorvastatin, simvastatin) showing stronger associations with reduced risk of metastatic and non-metastatic cancers, as well as prostate and breast cancer ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103746))

### 3. **Beta-Blockers**
Based on PubMed research:
- **Cardiovascular**: Standard treatment for hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, and post-myocardial infarction
- **Cancer**: Emerging research suggests beta-blockers may have protective effects. The Mendelian randomization study found suggestive evidence for a protective effect of β-blockers against lung cancer ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-025-04967-2))
- Beta-blockers like propranolol are being investigated for potential anti-cancer effects through stress hormone pathway modulation

### 4. **Doxorubicin (Anthracycline)**
This represents an interesting reverse case:
- **Cancer**: Widely used chemotherapy agent for treating lymphoma, breast cancer, and various other malignancies
- **Cardiovascular**: Unfortunately, causes significant cardiotoxicity and heart failure as a side effect, making it a drug that affects both systems but negatively impacts the cardiovascular system ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox15010027))

### 5. **Anticoagulants**
According to PubMed:
- **Cardiovascular**: Standard treatment for preventing thrombosis, stroke, and managing atrial fibrillation
- **Cancer**: Interestingly, recent research found that anticoagulant use was associated with longer progression-free survival in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma receiving immunotherapy ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.70307))

## Summary

The most notable drugs with beneficial indications in both areas are **aspirin**, **statins**, and **beta-blockers**. These cardiovascular medications show emerging evidence for cancer prevention benefits. Conversely, doxorubicin is an effective cancer drug that unfortunately causes cardiovascular complications. This highlights the complex interplay between cancer biology and cardiovascular health, an area known as cardio-oncology.
