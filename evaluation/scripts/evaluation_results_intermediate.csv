13,2025-12-18,Precision,What is the highest resolution ever achieved for a structure in the PDB?,True,True,True,1.0,"Based on my training knowledge, the highest resolution structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) have achieved resolutions better than 0.5 Å. Some of the highest resolution structures I'm aware of include small organic molecules and peptides that have been refined to resolutions around 0.48-0.54 Å.

These ultra-high resolution structures are typically:
- Small molecules or very small peptides
- Crystals that diffract exceptionally well
- Collected using high-intensity synchrotron radiation
- Often at cryogenic temperatures

For protein structures specifically (rather than small molecules), the highest resolutions are typically in the 0.8-1.2 Å range, though some small proteins have achieved better than 1.0 Å resolution.

However, I should note that resolution records may have been broken since my last training update, and the exact current record holder would require checking the most recent PDB statistics. The field of macromolecular crystallography continues to push the boundaries of achievable resolution.",,38.415351152420044,52,229,True,False,0.0,"Based on my search of the PDB database, I found several structures with exceptionally high resolution. From the search results, the highest resolution structure I identified is:

**PDB ID: 4REK** - Crystal structure of cholesterol oxidase from *Brevibacterium sterolicum* at **0.74 Å** resolution.

Other notable ultra-high resolution structures include:

1. **PDB ID: 1x8q and 1x8p** - Nitrophorin 4 from *Rhodnius prolixus* at **0.85 Å**
2. **PDB ID: 3zsj** - Human Galectin-3 CRD in complex with lactose at **0.86 Å**

5. **PDB ID: 5e7w** - Human recombinant 2Zn insulin at **0.92 Å**

1. **mTOR signalling** - This is the primary pathway dedicated to mTOR signaling itself

2. **mTORC1-mediated signalling** - Focused on mTOR Complex 1 signaling, which regulates protein synthesis, cell growth, and autophagy

3. **PI3K/AKT signalling** - mTOR is a key downstream effector of the PI3K/AKT pathway

4. **Insulin receptor signalling** - mTOR plays a crucial role in insulin-mediated metabolic signaling

5. **Growth factor signalling** - Various growth factor pathways converge on mTOR signaling

6. **Autophagy** - mTOR negatively regulates autophagy, so it appears in autophagy-related pathways

Here are the key Reactome pathways that involve mTOR:

## Core mTOR Signaling Pathways:

### 1. **MTOR signalling**
- The central pathway describing mTOR as a highly-conserved serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth and division in response to energy levels, growth signals, and nutrients
- mTOR exists as two distinct complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2

### 2. **mTORC1-mediated signalling** 
- mTORC1 integrates four major signals (growth factors, energy status, oxygen, and amino acids) to regulate processes involved in cell growth promotion
- Controls translation, lipid synthesis, autophagy, and cell growth

### 3. **Amino acids regulate mTORC1**
- Describes how amino acids positively regulate mTORC1 through multiple mechanisms involving:
  - Sestrin proteins (SESN1, SESN2) binding leucine
  - CASTOR proteins binding arginine  
  - BMT2 (SAMTOR) binding S-adenosylmethionine
  - SLC38A9 transporter acting as a GEF for Rag GTPases

### 4. **Energy dependent regulation of mTOR by LKB1-AMPK**
- Shows how energy depletion activates AMPK, which phosphorylates TSC2, leading to Rheb inactivation and mTOR inhibition

## Related Pathways Involving mTOR:

### 5. **Cellular response to starvation**
- Describes how mTORC1 acts as an integrator regulating translation, lipid synthesis, autophagy, and cell growth in response to nutrient deprivation

### 6. **Macroautophagy** 
- mTOR inactivation is a key trigger for autophagy induction during starvation
- The ULK complex acts as an integrator of autophagy signals downstream of mTORC1

### 7. **PI3K/AKT Signaling in Cancer**
- Describes dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors as therapeutic targets
- Shows how AKT activates mTOR signaling downstream of PI3K

### 8. **Activated NTRK2 signals through PI3K**
- NTRK2 (TRKB) activates PI3K → AKT → mTOR signaling pathway

### 9. **Signaling by Leptin**
- Leptin binding activates the mTOR/S6K pathway through IRS1/2 and PI3K/AKT

### 10. **Signaling by Erythropoietin**
- EPO signaling involves mTOR, SIRT1, and FOXO proteins in neurovascular protection

## Pathways Where mTOR is Regulated:

### 11. **TP53 Regulates Metabolic Genes**
- p53 negatively regulates mTOR signaling through multiple mechanisms including PTEN activation and sestrin expression

### 12. **Transcriptional Regulation by MECP2**
- Loss of MECP2 (in Rett syndrome) leads to decreased PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling activity

### 13. **Response of EIF2AK1 (HRI) to heme deficiency**
- EIF2AK1 represses mTORC1 signaling via ATF4-mediated induction of GRB10

### 14. **Regulation by TREX1**
- TREX1 deficiency affects mTORC1 activity, which regulates TFEB translocation and lysosomal biogenesis

These pathways demonstrate that mTOR signaling is central to cellular metabolism, growth control, autophagy regulation, and stress responses, with dysregulation implicated in cancer, metabolic diseases, and neurodevelopmental disorders.",,51.71652674674988,18,1780,51035,156580,"mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX biopax: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\nPREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?pathway ?pathwayName ?description\nWHERE {\n  ?pathway a biopax:Pathway .\n  ?pathway biopax:displayName ?pathwayName .\n  OPTIONAL { ?pathway biopax:comment ?description }\n  \n  FILTER(REGEX(?pathwayName, \""mTOR\"", \""i\"") || REGEX(?description, \""mTOR\"", \""i\""))\n}\nORDER BY ?pathwayName""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX biopax: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?pathway ?pathwayName \nWHERE {\n  ?pathway a biopax:Pathway .\n  ?pathway biopax:displayName ?pathwayName .\n  \n  FILTER(REGEX(?pathwayName, \""^mTOR\"", \""i\"") || REGEX(?pathwayName, \""MTOR\"", \""i\""))\n}\nORDER BY ?pathwayName""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX biopax: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?pathway ?pathwayName ?description\nWHERE {\n  ?pathway a biopax:Pathway .\n  ?pathway biopax:displayName ?pathwayName .\n  ?pathway biopax:comment ?description .\n  \n  FILTER(REGEX(?description, \""mTOR\"", \""i\""))\n  FILTER(!REGEX(?pathwayName, \""mTOR\"", \""i\""))\n}\nORDER BY ?pathwayName\nLIMIT 20""}}]",CRITICAL,Multiple MTOR signalling pathway instances across species,Database: Reactome.

- **8T6O** - 0 bp R-loop (initial binding)
- **8T6P** - 2 bp R-loop
- **8T76** - 3 bp R-loop
- **8T77** - 6 bp R-loop (non-target DNA)
- **8T78** - 8 bp R-loop (non-target DNA)
- **8T6S** - 10 bp R-loop
- **8T79** - 10 bp R-loop (non-target DNA)
- **8T6T** - 13 bp R-loop
- **8T6X** - 18 bp R-loop

### Off-target Binding Studies:
- **8T6Y** - SpRY-Cas9:gRNA complex bound to non-target DNA with 1 bp R-loop

### SpRYmer Variant:
- **8T7S** - SpRYmer bound to NAC PAM DNA

### Related SpG-Cas9 Structures:
- **8TZZ** - SpG Cas9 with NGC PAM DNA target
- **8U3Y** - SpG Cas9 with NGG PAM DNA target

## Key Features:

**SpRY-Cas9** is a significant variant because it has **relaxed PAM requirements** compared to wild-type Cas9, recognizing NYN PAMs (where N is any nucleotide) instead of the restrictive NGG PAM requirement of SpCas9.

The structures show SpRY-Cas9 complexes with various PAM sequences:
- **TGG** (traditional NGG-like)
- **TTC** (expanded specificity)
- **TAC** (expanded specificity)
- **NAC** (for SpRYmer variant)

The R-loop formation series (8T6O through 8T6X) provides unprecedented structural insight into the step-by-step process of DNA unwinding and target recognition, which is crucial for understanding SpRY-Cas9's enhanced PAM flexibility.

These structures represent some of the most recent advances in understanding Cas9 variants with expanded targeting capabilities, which is important for improving CRISPR gene editing applications.",,49.82946586608887,26,1846,2538,119741,"mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity"", ""input"": {""db"": ""pdb"", ""query"": ""SpRY-Cas9 variant"", ""limit"": 20}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity"", ""input"": {""db"": ""pdb"", ""query"": ""SpRY Cas9"", ""limit"": 25}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX pdbx: <http://pdbml.pdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.xsd#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT ?pdb_id ?title ?deposition_date ?release_date ?method WHERE {\n  VALUES ?pdb_id { \""8SPQ\"" \""8T76\"" \""8T6P\"" \""8T6Y\"" \""8T6T\"" \""8T78\"" \""8SQH\"" \""8SRS\"" \""8T6O\"" \""8T77\"" \""8T6X\"" \""8T6S\"" \""8T79\"" \""8T7S\"" }\n  \n  ?entity pdbx:has_struct ?struct .\n  ?struct pdbx:has_structCategory ?structCat .\n  ?structCat pdbx:has_struct ?structEntry .\n  ?structEntry pdbx:struct.entry_id ?pdb_id ;\n               pdbx:struct.title ?title .\n  \n  OPTIONAL {\n    ?entity pdbx:has_database_PDB_rev ?dbRev .\n    ?dbRev pdbx:has_database_PDB_revCategory ?revCat .\n    ?revCat pdbx:has_database_PDB_rev ?revEntry .\n    ?revEntry pdbx:database_PDB_rev.date_original ?deposition_date ;\n              pdbx:database_PDB_rev.date ?release_date .\n  }\n  \n  OPTIONAL {\n    ?entity pdbx:has_exptl ?exptl .\n    ?exptl pdbx:has_exptlCategory ?exptlCat .\n    ?exptlCat pdbx:has_exptl ?exptlEntry .\n    ?exptlEntry pdbx:exptl.method ?method .\n  }\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?release_date)""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX pdbx: <http://pdbml.pdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.xsd#>\n\nSELECT ?pdb_id ?title WHERE {\n  ?entry rdf:type pdbx:datablock ;\n         pdbx:datablockName ?pdb_id ;\n         pdbx:has_struct ?struct .\n  ?struct pdbx:has_structCategory ?structCat .\n  ?structCat pdbx:has_struct ?structEntry .\n  ?structEntry pdbx:struct.title ?title .\n  \n  FILTER(regex(?title, \""SpRY\"", \""i\""))\n}\nLIMIT 20""}}]",CRITICAL,"PDB IDs including 8SPQ, 8SQH, 8SRS","Database: PDB.

22,2025-12-18,Specificity,What is the molecular weight range of FDA-approved drugs in PubChem?,True,False,True,0.5,"I don't have access to current PubChem database statistics to give you the exact molecular weight range of FDA-approved drugs currently in their database.

However, I can share some general knowledge about FDA-approved drug molecular weights based on pharmaceutical research:

**Typical ranges for FDA-approved drugs:**
- Most small molecule drugs fall between **150-800 Da**
- The majority cluster around **200-600 Da**
- Some outliers extend beyond 1000 Da, particularly for more complex molecules

**Historical context:**
- Early drug discovery often followed ""Lipinski's Rule of Five,"" suggesting molecular weights under 500 Da
- Modern drug development has increasingly accepted larger molecules (500-800 Da range)
- Biologics and peptide drugs can have much higher molecular weights (thousands of Da)

**Extremes:**
- Some of the smallest approved drugs are around 100-150 Da
- Some complex small molecules and peptides can exceed 1000-2000 Da

For the most current and precise molecular weight distribution of FDA-approved drugs in PubChem, you would need to query their database directly or check their published statistics, as this data changes as new drugs are approved and added to the database.",,8.442035913467407,54,270,True,False,0.375,"Based on my search through PubMed and biomedical literature, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the molecular weight range of FDA-approved drugs in PubChem.

According to PubMed research, particularly from a key study by Douguet (2018), here are the key findings about molecular weight ranges of FDA-approved drugs:

## Molecular Weight Distribution of FDA-Approved Drugs

**Primary Finding:** According to the comprehensive analysis published in [ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.7b00462), **1,852 FDA-approved chemical structures have been identified with molecular weights less than 2,000 Da**, with 492 of these having active metabolites.

## Key Molecular Weight Insights:

1. **Upper Limit**: The study set a molecular weight threshold of **less than 2,000 Da** for FDA-approved drugs in their comprehensive database.

2. **Lipinski's Rule Compliance**: According to research published in [ChemistryOpen](https://doi.org/10.1002/open.201600015), most approved drugs with optimal properties have molecular weights **not exceeding 500 Da**, which aligns with Lipinski's Rule of Five - a widely used guideline in drug development.

3. **Target-Class Variations**: Research in [Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2015.04.063) shows that:
   - **Antibacterials targeting riboproteins** tend to have higher molecular weights and fall outside conventional ""drug-like"" chemical space
   - **Antibacterials targeting bacterial proteins** generally comply with the Rule of Five (MW ≤ 500 Da)

## Practical Implications:

- **Most common range**: The majority of FDA-approved small molecule drugs fall within the **150-500 Da range**
- **Outliers exist**: Some approved drugs, particularly complex antibiotics and certain specialized therapeutics, can reach up to 2,000 Da
- **Drug-like properties**: Drugs in the lower molecular weight ranges (≤500 Da) generally have better oral bioavailability and drug-like characteristics

This data represents one of the most comprehensive analyses of FDA-approved drug molecular weights available, compiled from official FDA drug labels and molecular structure databases.
