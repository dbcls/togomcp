### Session Notes
**PubTator:**
- 234 million total annotations (162M disease + 72M gene)
- Text-mined entity annotations from PubMed literature
- Links MeSH disease terms and NCBI Gene IDs to PubMed articles
- Annotation counts track mention frequency within articles (1-9 range observed)
- Rich cross-database integration with PubMed, NCBI Gene via shared endpoint
- No source attribution populated in current data (dcterms:source empty)
- Excellent for literature-based gene-disease association discovery
- Key patterns: gene-disease co-mentions, high-frequency mentions, cross-database enrichment

### Exploration Summary

All 23 databases have been thoroughly explored with:
- MIE file analysis (schema, properties, relationships)
- Search queries to discover real entities
- SPARQL queries adapted from MIE patterns with different entities
- Cross-reference analysis where applicable
- Question opportunities identified by category

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 2: Question Generation
- Use exploration reports to create 120 questions
- Follow distribution plan in 00_SUMMARY.md
