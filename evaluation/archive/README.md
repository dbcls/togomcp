## Files

### `EVALUATION_README.md` (Archived 2025-12-18)

**Status**: Replaced by README.md

**Why archived**: This was an early comprehensive documentation file that duplicated content now better organized across:
- **README.md** - Quick start and entry point
- **QUESTION_DESIGN_GUIDE.md** - Question creation guide
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Progress tracking
- **scripts/README.md** - Automated evaluation guide

**If you need it**: The file is preserved here for historical reference, but users should use the current documentation structure instead.

## Subdirectories

### `manual_evaluation/`

Contains manual evaluation templates (rubric, templates, tracker) that were replaced by automated evaluation scripts.

**See**: [`manual_evaluation/README.md`](manual_evaluation/README.md) for details.

**Note**: Files are archived rather than deleted to preserve project history and allow reference if needed. However, all active users should use the current documentation in the parent directory.
