      "question": "What is the UniProt accession ID for the CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M1?",
      "expected_answer": "Q99ZW2",
      "notes": "Uses UniProt database. Verified in uniprot_exploration.md where search_uniprot_entity for 'CRISPR-associated protein Cas9' returned Q99ZW2 for SpCas9/SpyCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes M1, the most commonly used Cas9 variant in genome editing. This requires precise protein identification across multiple Cas9 orthologs (SaCas9, St-Cas9, etc.), not general knowledge about CRISPR."

      "notes": "Uses PubChem database. Verified in pubchem_exploration.md where get_compound_attributes_from_pubchem for CID2244 returned molecular weight 180.16 and molecular formula C9H8O4. This tests exact molecular descriptor retrieval, which requires database access rather than memorized chemical properties."

      "expected_answer": "25",
      "notes": "Uses GO database. Verified in go_exploration.md where OLS4:getDescendants for GO:0006914 returned totalElements: 25, including macroautophagy, microautophagy, mitophagy, lipophagy, aggrephagy, xenophagy, and other specialized forms. This tests ontology hierarchy navigation and comprehensive counting, requiring database access to traverse the DAG structure."

Verified in clinvar_exploration.md where counting variants by type (GROUP BY cvo:variation_type) returned 3,236,823 single nucleotide variants, representing 90% of all 3.5M+ variants. This tests ability to aggregate large datasets and requires current database statistics, not training knowledge."

      "notes": "Uses UniProt and NCBI Gene databases with TogoID. Verified in uniprot_exploration.md where P04637 is TP53_HUMAN (tumor suppressor p53). The exploration confirmed cross-references to NCBI Gene, and the conversion P04637→7157 represents a fundamental integration task testing cross-database ID mapping via TogoID."

      "notes": "Uses PDB and UniProt databases. Verified in pdb_exploration.md which documented that ~172% of PDB entries have UniProt cross-references (multiple per structure due to multiple chains). Entry 16PK is mentioned as an example. This tests PDB→UniProt integration through struct_ref cross-references, requiring database access to resolve the mapping."

      "notes": "Uses Reactome database. Verified in reactome_exploration.md where search for 'mTOR' returned 10 mTOR signalling pathway instances across different species. The exploration confirmed mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) is a central regulator of cell growth with multiple pathway connections. This tests access to current pathway annotations that may be updated with new discoveries."

The exploration documented the hierarchical MeSH system with tree numbers and showed D003920 has multiple specialized subtypes. This tests precise medical terminology identification in a controlled vocabulary."

Verified in nando_exploration.md where keyword search for 'Parkinson*' returned NANDO:1200010 as Parkinson's disease (パーキンソン病), along with related conditions like rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism and multiple system atrophy, Parkinsonian type. This tests access to Japanese rare disease terminology and demonstrates specificity in a specialized national database."

Verified in chembl_exploration.md where a structured query filtering by standardType='IC50', standardUnits='nM', and value<100 against targets with 'kinase' in label was tested. The exploration documented 20M bioactivity measurements and demonstrated filtering by activity type and numeric thresholds. This tests complex structured queries with multiple filter conditions."
