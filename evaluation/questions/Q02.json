      "question": "What is the highest resolution ever achieved for a protein structure in the PDB database?",
      "expected_answer": "0.48 Å",
      "notes": "Uses PDB database. Verified in pdb_exploration.md where ultra-high resolution query found two structures tied for best resolution: 5D8V (R-work: 0.072) and 3NIR (R-work: 0.127), both at 0.48 Å. This represents atomic-level crystallographic resolution, requiring database access for current records rather than general knowledge."
