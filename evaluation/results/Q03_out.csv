As of my training data (with knowledge up to early 2024), the number of cryo-EM structures in the PDB has been growing rapidly:

- In the early 2010s, cryo-EM structures were relatively rare (hundreds)
- By around 2020, there were several thousand cryo-EM structures
- The growth has been exponential, particularly after the ""resolution revolution"" in cryo-EM that began around 2013-2014
- By 2023-2024, estimates suggested there were likely **15,000-20,000+ cryo-EM structures** deposited in the PDB

However, these numbers are constantly changing as new structures are deposited weekly. For the most current and accurate count, you would need to query the PDB directly (www.rcsb.org) using their search tools, filtering by experimental method ""Electron Microscopy.""

Based on the search results from the PDB (Protein Data Bank) database, there are **33,945 structures** that were determined by electron microscopy (including cryo-EM).

This represents a significant portion of all PDB structures and highlights the growing importance of cryo-electron microscopy as a structural biology technique. Cryo-EM has become particularly valuable for determining structures of large macromolecular complexes, membrane proteins, and other challenging targets that are difficult to crystallize for X-ray crystallography.

The search results show examples of various types of structures determined by cryo-EM, including:
