However, I can tell you that:

1. **MONDO (Monarch Disease Ontology)** is a disease ontology that integrates multiple disease resources and provides cross-references to various databases, including OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man).

2. **OMIM** is one of the major sources integrated into MONDO, particularly for Mendelian/genetic diseases.

To get the exact current number, you would need to:
- Query the MONDO database directly
- Check the latest MONDO release notes/statistics
- Use tools like the OLS (Ontology Lookup Service) or the Monarch Initiative's data services
