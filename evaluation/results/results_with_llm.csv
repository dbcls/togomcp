## Genetic Variants Associated with Diabetes Mellitus

### Key Genes Involved

According to data from ClinVar and NCBI Gene databases, there are over **25,000 genetic variants** in ClinVar associated with diabetes mellitus, and **732 genes** that have been linked to diabetes through pathogenic or risk factor associations. Here are the major genes:

#### 1. **Monogenic Diabetes Genes**

**HNF1A** (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-Alpha):
- Associated with Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young type 3 (MODY3)
- Example variant: c.1413del (p.Tyr472fs) - classified as **Pathogenic**
- Located on chromosome 12q24.31

**GCK** (Glucokinase):
- Associated with various forms of diabetes
- Example variant: c.1231T>C (p.Ser411Pro) - classified as **Likely Pathogenic**
- Located on chromosome 7p13

**KCNJ11** (Potassium Channel):
- Associated with neonatal diabetes and Type 2 diabetes
- Example variant: c.1000G>A (p.Gly334Ser) - classified as **Likely Pathogenic**
- Located on chromosome 11p15.1

**SLC19A2** (Thiamine Transporter):
- Associated with megaloblastic anemia, thiamine-responsive, with diabetes mellitus and sensorineural deafness
- Located on chromosome 1q24.2

**ZFP57** (Zinc Finger Protein):
- Associated with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus type 1
- Located on chromosome 6p22.1

**WFS1** (Wolframin):
- Associated with Wolfram syndrome and diabetes
- Located on chromosome 4p16.1

#### 2. **Common Variant Genes (Type 2 Diabetes)**

According to PubMed research on genome-wide association studies (GWAS):

**TCF7L2** (Transcription Factor 7-Like 2):
- One of the strongest genetic risk factors for Type 2 diabetes
- Multiple variants identified across populations

**KCNQ1** (Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel):
- Commonly associated with Type 2 diabetes risk
- Particularly prevalent in East Asian populations

**CDKAL1** (CDK5 Regulatory Subunit Associated Protein 1-Like 1):
- Associated with impaired insulin secretion
- Multiple variants identified in GWAS

**HHEX** (Hematopoietically Expressed Homeobox):
- Associated with Type 2 diabetes risk
- Involved in pancreatic development

#### 3. **Genes Related to Diabetic Complications**

Several genes are associated with diabetic retinopathy and other complications, though the genetic architecture is complex and involves:
- Vascular endothelial growth factor pathways (**VEGFA**)
- Inflammatory pathways (**IL6**, **TNF**)
- Apolipoprotein metabolism (**APOE**)

### Recent Research Findings

According to recent PubMed articles:

1. **Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS)**: A 2025 study published in *International Journal of Molecular Sciences* demonstrated that PRS-based genetic testing using variants in TCF7L2, KCNQ1, CDKAL1, and HHEX can stratify individuals according to diabetes risk, with the very high-risk group showing a 4.5-fold increased risk of developing diabetes ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms27010275)).

2. **Portability Issues**: A 2026 study in *Nature Communications* highlighted that polygenic score portability varies significantly across populations and that genetic distance alone doesn't fully explain individual-level prediction accuracy ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68565-3)).

3. **Precision Medicine**: Research published in the *Journal of Clinical Medicine* emphasizes that genetic factors account for **25-50% of the risk** of developing diabetic complications, with advances in genomics paving the way for personalized medicine approaches ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14248778)).

### Clinical Significance

The genetic variants associated with diabetes mellitus can be categorized by:

- **Monogenic forms**: Rare, highly penetrant mutations (e.g., MODY subtypes, neonatal diabetes)
- **Polygenic forms**: Common variants with small individual effects but significant cumulative risk (Type 2 diabetes)
- **Syndromic forms**: Diabetes as part of broader genetic syndromes (e.g., Alström syndrome, Wolfram syndrome)

### Conclusion

Genetic testing for diabetes is becoming increasingly important for:
- Early risk stratification
- Personalized treatment strategies
- Understanding disease mechanisms
- Predicting complications

The field is moving toward precision medicine approaches that integrate genetic information with lifestyle factors for optimal diabetes prevention and management.",,48.426477909088135,23,1870,39366,119452,"mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esummary, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esummary, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch"", ""input"": {""database"": ""clinvar"", ""query"": ""diabetes mellitus"", ""max_results"": 50}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esummary"", ""input"": {""database"": ""clinvar"", ""ids"": [""4686065"", ""4685995"", ""4685911"", ""4685806"", ""4685647"", ""4685500"", ""4685475"", ""4684987"", ""4682665"", ""4682447""]}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch"", ""input"": {""database"": ""gene"", ""query"": ""diabetes mellitus AND (pathogenic OR risk factor)"", ""max_results"": 20}}, {""name"": ""mcp__pubmed__search_articles"", ""input"": {""query"": ""diabetes mellitus genetic variants GWAS"", ""max_results"": 10}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esummary"", ""input"": {""database"": ""gene"", ""ids"": [""7157"", ""1956"", ""348"", ""7124"", ""3569"", ""7422"", ""7040"", ""4524""]}}, {""name"": ""mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata"", ""input"": {""pmids"": [""41587969"", ""41516154"", ""41464680""]}}]",VALUABLE,"List of ClinVar variants associated with diabetes mellitus, including variants in genes such as INS, WFS1, KCNJ11, GCK","COMPLEX QUERY requiring cross-database knowledge.

   - AGC kinase activation (AKT/PKB phosphorylation)

3. **PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway**
   - Growth factor receptor signaling
   - Cellular metabolism and growth
   - Cell survival mechanisms

4. **Nutrient Sensing Pathways**
   - Amino acid transporters and sensors
   - Glucose metabolism connections
   - Autophagy regulation (mTOR inhibits autophagy)

5. **AMPK-mTOR Interactions**
   - Energy stress responses
   - Metabolic switching

## **Small Molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)**

### First-generation (reversible):
- **Gefitinib** (Iressa) - IC50 ~1-20 nM
- **Erlotinib** (Tarceva) - IC50 ~2 nM
- These are selective for EGFR but reversibly bind

### Second-generation (irreversible):
- **Afatinib** (Gilotrif) - IC50 ~0.5 nM - covalently binds to EGFR
- **Dacomitinib** - IC50 ~0.6 nM
- These are pan-HER inhibitors (target EGFR, HER2, HER4)

### Third-generation (irreversible, mutant-selective):
- **Osimertinib** (Tagrisso) - IC50 ~12-15 nM for mutant EGFR, >200 nM for wild-type
- Designed to overcome T790M resistance mutation while sparing wild-type EGFR

## **Monoclonal Antibodies**

- **Cetuximab** (Erbitux) - Kd ~0.2 nM
- **Panitumumab** (Vectibix) - Kd ~0.05 nM
- These bind the extracellular domain, preventing ligand binding

## **Potency Considerations**

The ""most potent"" depends on context:

However, I can explain how ChEMBL and PubChem compounds are generally linked:

**How the databases are linked:**

1. **Cross-references**: Both ChEMBL and PubChem maintain cross-reference mappings between their compound identifiers. ChEMBL records often include PubChem CID (Compound ID) links, and PubChem records similarly reference ChEMBL IDs.

2. **Structure-based matching**: The primary way these compounds are linked is through their chemical structures. Both databases use standardized structure representations (like InChI and InChI Keys) to identify identical or related compounds across different databases.

3. **UniChem**: The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) maintains UniChem, a service specifically designed to map chemical structures across different databases, including ChEMBL and PubChem.

To find the specific PubChem CID for CHEMBL941, you would typically:
- Query the ChEMBL database directly for CHEMBL941's record
- Use UniChem's cross-reference service
- Search PubChem using the ChEMBL ID or the compound's structure/name

I have found comprehensive information about CHEMBL941 and its PubChem compound ID. Let me provide you with a complete answer.

## Answer

**CHEMBL941** (Imatinib) corresponds to **PubChem Compound ID: 5291**

### How They Are Linked

The connection between ChEMBL and PubChem databases is established through **cross-reference mappings** in the ChEMBL RDF database. Specifically:

1. **Direct Cross-Reference**: ChEMBL compounds link to PubChem using the property `cco:moleculeXref`, which points to the PubChem compound URI:
   - ChEMBL URI: `http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/resource/chembl/molecule/CHEMBL941`
   - PubChem URI: `http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5291`

2. **Relationship Type**: According to the TogoID database, the relationship between ChEMBL compounds and PubChem compounds is classified as ""**is nearly equivalent to**"" (bidirectional), meaning they represent the same chemical entity but may have slightly different representations or metadata in each database.

### Additional Cross-References

CHEMBL941 (Imatinib) is also linked to many other databases, including:
- **ChEBI**: CHEBI:45783 (via `skos:exactMatch`)
- **DrugBank**: DB00619
- **HMDB**: HMDB0014757
- **PDB**: Chemical component STI
- **ZINC**: ZINC000019632618

## Examples of genes with historically high rates of conflicts:
- **BRCA1 and BRCA2** - breast/ovarian cancer genes
- **MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2** - Lynch syndrome genes
- **LDLR** - familial hypercholesterolemia
- **SCN5A** - cardiac arrhythmia gene
- **KCNQ1, KCNH2** - Long QT syndrome genes

## Why conflicts occur:
- Different evidence thresholds
- Access to different patient/family data
- Different computational predictions
- Evolving evidence over time
- Different interpretation of ACMG/AMP guidelines

**Note:** I cannot query the current ClinVar database to give you specific variant IDs or current statistics.

## ClinVar Variants with Conflicting Clinical Interpretations

I found **numerous variants** in ClinVar where different laboratories have submitted conflicting interpretations of their pathogenicity. Here are the most notable examples with the highest number of submitters:

### Top 5 Variants with Conflicting Interpretations:

1. **SPG7 c.1529C>T (p.Ala510Val)** - VCV000042016
   - **64 submitters** with conflicting classifications
   - Gene: SPG7 (chromosome 16)
   - Associated with: Hereditary spastic paraplegia type 7, ataxia
   - Allele frequency: ~0.36% in population databases

2. **APC c.3920T>A (p.Ile1307Lys)** - VCV000000822

### Additional Notable Examples:

- **BTD c.1270G>C** (50 submitters) - Biotinidase deficiency
- **CHEK2 c.1427C>T** (50 submitters) - Breast/ovarian cancer predisposition

- **TNFRSF13B c.310T>C** (45 submitters) - Immunodeficiency
- **CHEK2 c.470T>C** (43 submitters) - Cancer predisposition

### Why Do Conflicting Interpretations Occur?

Conflicts arise due to:
- **Different evidence levels** - Labs may have access to different functional studies or patient data
- **Population frequency considerations** - Some variants are common in certain populations but rare in others
- **Incomplete penetrance** - Not all carriers develop disease
- **Variant effect complexity** - Effects may depend on genetic background or be context-dependent
- **Evolving evidence** - As new data emerges, interpretations change but historical submissions remain

22,2026-01-31,Currency,Which Reactome pathways have been associated with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing mechanisms?,True,False,True,0.75,"I don't have specific information in my training data about Reactome pathways directly associated with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing mechanisms.

This is likely because:

1. **CRISPR-Cas9 is a bacterial adaptive immune system** - It originated in bacteria and archaea as a defense mechanism against viruses, not as an endogenous human/mammalian pathway.

2. **Reactome focuses on biological pathways** - Reactome is a curated database of biological pathways primarily in humans and model organisms. CRISPR-Cas9 itself is an engineered tool used for research and therapeutic applications rather than a natural biological pathway in these organisms.

3. **Related pathways might include**:
   - **DNA repair pathways** (like Non-Homologous End Joining - NHEJ, and Homology Directed Repair - HDR) that are activated after CRISPR-Cas9 creates double-strand breaks
   - **DNA damage response pathways**
   - Pathways involved in **genome stability**

If you're looking for pathways related to the cellular responses and mechanisms that occur *after* CRISPR-Cas9 introduces DNA breaks, those DNA repair and damage response pathways in Reactome would be most relevant. However, I cannot provide specific Reactome pathway identifiers or detailed associations with certainty from my training knowledge alone.

Would you like me to discuss the DNA repair mechanisms that are commonly exploited in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing applications?",,8.22296404838562,60,346,True,True,0.625,"Based on my search of the Reactome database, **CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing mechanisms are not currently represented as specific pathways in Reactome**. The searches for ""CRISPR,"" ""Cas9,"" and ""CRISPR-Cas9"" did not return any dedicated CRISPR-related pathways.

However, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing relies on cellular DNA repair mechanisms that **are** well-documented in Reactome. The most relevant pathways would be:

## Related DNA Repair Pathways:

1. **DNA Double-Strand Break Repair (R-HSA-5693532)** - This is the primary pathway relevant to CRISPR-Cas9, as Cas9 creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA

2. **DNA Double Strand Break Response (R-HSA-5693606)** - The cellular response to DSBs, which is triggered by CRISPR-Cas9 cutting activity

These pathways are available across multiple species in Reactome (human, mouse, rat, dog, cow, pig, zebrafish, chicken, and others).

## Why This Matters:

When CRISPR-Cas9 cuts DNA at a target site, cells repair the break using one of two main mechanisms:
- **Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)** - error-prone repair
- **Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)** - precise repair using a template

Both of these repair mechanisms are part of the DNA Double-Strand Break Repair pathway in Reactome.

34,2026-01-31,Currency,What antimicrobial resistance patterns are most prevalent in Salmonella isolates?,True,True,True,0.5833333333333334,"# Common Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns in Salmonella Isolates

Based on global surveillance data, here are the most prevalent resistance patterns:

## Most Common Resistance Patterns

### 1. **Classic Multidrug Resistance (MDR)**
- **ACSSuT pattern**: Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, Streptomycin, Sulfonamides, and Tetracycline
- Historically very common, especially in S. Typhimurium DT104
- Frequently encoded on integrons and plasmids

### 2. **Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) Resistance**
- Increasing concern globally
- Particularly in S. Kentucky, S. Infantis, and S. Enteritidis
- Resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime)
- Often CTX-M type ESBLs

### 3. **Fluoroquinolone Resistance**
- **Decreased susceptibility/resistance to ciprofloxacin**
- Common in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi (especially from South Asia)
- Mediated by mutations in gyrA and parC genes
- Also seen via plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes

## Serotype-Specific Patterns

- **S. Typhimurium**: ACSSuT, ampicillin resistance
- **S. Kentucky**: High MDR rates, ESBL, fluoroquinolone resistance
- **S. Infantis**: Increasing ESBL production, MDR
- **S. Typhi**: Fluoroquinolone resistance, emerging azithromycin resistance (XDR strains)

## Geographic Variations

Resistance patterns vary significantly by region, with higher MDR rates typically in:
- South/Southeast Asia
- Sub-Saharan Africa
- Parts of Latin America

**Note**: Carbapenem resistance remains rare but has been reported.",,10.667433977127075,55,479,True,True,0.8333333333333334,"Based on my analysis of both recent PubMed literature and the AMR Portal database containing 1.7 million antimicrobial susceptibility test results, here are the most prevalent antimicrobial resistance patterns in Salmonella isolates:

## Most Common Resistance Patterns

According to the AMR Portal database, the antibiotics showing the highest resistance in Salmonella are:

### Top Resistance Categories:

1. **Tetracycline** - 6,969 resistant isolates (26.3% resistance rate)
2. **Ampicillin** - 5,730 resistant isolates (20.4% resistance rate)
3. **Streptomycin** - 5,394 resistant isolates (23.1% resistance rate)
4. **Nalidixic acid** - 3,821 resistant isolates (15.5% resistance rate)
5. **Sulfisoxazole** - 3,724 resistant isolates (16.8% resistance rate)
6. **Chloramphenicol** - 2,933 resistant isolates (10.4% resistance rate)
7. **Ciprofloxacin** - 2,250 resistant isolates (8.1% resistance rate)

### Key Findings from Recent Literature:

According to PubMed, recent studies highlight several important trends:

1. **Multidrug Resistance (MDR)** is highly prevalent:
   - A Hong Kong study found **68.7% multidrug non-susceptibility** in retail meat samples ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2025.117918))
   - MDR Salmonella Infantis in Korean broilers showed resistance to at least 5 antimicrobial families including ampicillin, cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2024.0162))

2. **Critical Antibiotic Resistance**:
   - **Ciprofloxacin**: 69.6% non-susceptibility in Hong Kong food samples
   - **Ceftriaxone** (3rd-generation cephalosporin): 7.8% non-susceptibility
   - **Azithromycin**: 8.3% non-susceptibility
   - These are particularly concerning as they're first-line treatments for invasive salmonellosis

3. **Predominant Resistance Gene Classes**:
   - **Quinolone resistance**: qnrS genes, gyrA mutations
   - **Trimethoprim**: dfrA genes
   - **Sulfonamides**: sul genes
   - **Tetracyclines**: tet genes
   - **Aminoglycosides**: aadA genes

4. **Serotype-Specific Patterns**:
   - **S. Typhimurium, S. Rissen, S. Derby, S. London**: High MDR rates, mainly from pork/beef
   - **S. Infantis**: Emerging global clone with megaplasmids carrying multiple resistance genes
   - **S. Enteritidis**: Consistently involved in outbreaks

5. **Resistance Mechanisms**:
   - Plasmid-mediated resistance (especially IncR, IncX2, IncHI2 plasmids)
   - Chromosomal resistance regions (58 kb MDR regions reported)
   - Efflux pumps and point mutations (e.g., gyrA D87Y for quinolone resistance)

### Public Health Implications:

The resistance patterns show that traditional first-line antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin) have significantly reduced efficacy. The emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid) and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ceftriaxone) is particularly concerning for treating invasive infections.

Human immunoglobulins (antibodies) contain several well-characterized glycosylation sites that are crucial for their structure and function:

## IgG (Most studied)

**Fc Region (Conserved):**
- **Asn297** (Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif) in the CH2 domain - This is the most important and conserved N-glycosylation site
- Present in all four IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4)
- Essential for effector functions (ADCC, CDC, complement binding)
- Typically carries complex biantennary glycans

**Fab Region (Variable):**
- Approximately 15-25% of human IgGs have additional glycosylation in the variable regions
- Sites vary depending on the specific antibody sequence
- Can occur in both heavy and light chain variable regions

## IgA

- **5 N-glycosylation sites** in IgA1 (Asn263, Asn459 in tailpiece, and others)
- **4 N-glycosylation sites** in IgA2
- **O-glycosylation** unique to IgA1: in the hinge region (9-15 sites on Ser/Thr residues)

## IgM

- **5 N-glycosylation sites** per heavy chain
- Located in CH1, CH2, CH3, and CH4 domains
- Heavily glycosylated due to pentameric structure

## IgE

- **6-7 N-glycosylation sites** per heavy chain
- Distributed across CH2, CH3, and CH4 domains

## IgD

- Multiple N-glycosylation sites (exact number varies)
- Highly glycosylated relative to protein size

The glycosylation patterns affect antibody stability, solubility, serum half-life, and immunological functions.",,11.230297088623049,54,481,True,True,0.8888888888888888,"Excellent! Now I have comprehensive information about glycosylation sites in human immunoglobulin proteins. Let me compile this information for you.

## Glycosylation Sites in Human Immunoglobulin Proteins

Based on information from UniProt databases and recent PubMed research, human immunoglobulin proteins have well-characterized glycosylation sites that vary by antibody class and subclass:

### **IgG (Immunoglobulin G) - Heavy Chain Constant Regions**

**N-glycosylation sites:**
- **IgG1** (P01857): Position **N297** (Asn-180 in mature protein) - Complex-type N-glycans
- **IgG2** (P01859): Position **N176** - Complex-type N-glycans  
- **IgG3** (P01860): Positions **N227** and **N322** - N-linked glycans
- **IgG4** (P01861): Position **N177** - Complex-type N-glycans

**O-glycosylation sites (IgG3 only):**
- Positions **T122, T137, T152** - O-linked GalNAc glycans in the extended hinge region

### **IgA (Immunoglobulin A) - Heavy Chain**

According to PubMed research ([DOI: 10.3389/fmolb.2025.1595173](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1595173)):

**IgA1 N-glycosylation sites:**
- **N144** (C2 domain) - Non-fucosylated hybrid-type and di-antennary complex-type glycans
- **N340** (C3 domain/tailpiece) - Fucosylated di- or multi-antennary complex-type glycans with sialylation

**IgA2 N-glycosylation sites:**
- **N47** (C1 domain/Fab region)
- **N92** (C1 domain) - Present only in m2 and n allotypes
- **N131** (C2 domain) - Homologous to IgA1 N144
- **N205** (C2 domain)
- **N327** (C3 domain/tailpiece) - Homologous to IgA1 N340

**IgA special glycan modifications:**
- Sulfated N-glycans (primarily at tailpiece sites N340/N327)
- O-acetylated sialic acid (at tailpiece)

### **IgD (Immunoglobulin D) - Heavy Chain**

**N-glycosylation sites (P0DOX3):**
- Positions with N-linked GlcNAc glycans

**O-glycosylation sites:**
- Multiple threonine and serine residues with O-linked GalNAc

### **IgE (Immunoglobulin E) - Heavy Chain**

**N-glycosylation sites (P01854, P0DOX4):**
- **Seven N-glycosylation sites** distributed across the constant domains
- IgE has more glycosylation sites than other immunoglobulin classes

### **IgM (Immunoglobulin M) - Heavy Chain**

**N-glycosylation sites (P01871):**
- **N46** - Complex-type N-glycans
- **N209** - Complex-type N-glycans
- **N272** - N-linked glycans
- **N279** - N-linked glycans
- **N440** - N-linked glycans (at tailpiece)

### **Functional Significance**

According to PubMed research, glycosylation at specific sites is critical for:

1. **Fc receptor binding** - The conserved N-glycan at IgG N297 is essential for FcγR binding and effector functions
2. **Antibody stability and conformation** - Glycans stabilize protein structure
3. **Anti-viral activity** - Sialylated glycans on IgA tailpiece interfere with sialic-acid-binding viruses
4. **Serum half-life** - Glycosylation affects antibody clearance rates
5. **Complement activation** - Tailpiece glycosylation in IgA affects C3 binding

The glycan structures are predominantly **complex-type**, **hybrid-type**, or **high-mannose** N-glycans with varying degrees of fucosylation, galactosylation, sialylation, and bisecting GlcNAc.

The highest resolution protein structures currently available in the PDB are at **0.48 Å (angstroms)** resolution. There are two structures that share this record:

1. **5D8V** - Ultra-high resolution structure of high-potential iron-sulfur protein
2. **3NIR** - Crystal structure of small protein crambin at 0.48 Å resolution

Both were determined using X-ray diffraction. This represents truly atomic-level resolution where individual atoms and even electron density details can be clearly resolved.

- **3P4J** - Z-DNA structure at 0.55 Å
- **5NW3** - Perdeuterated Pyrococcus furiosus Rubredoxin at 0.59 Å

However, I can provide some context:

**The main autophagy-related GO terms include:**
- GO:0006914 - ""autophagy"" (the main parent term)
- GO:0000045 - ""autophagosome assembly""
- GO:0016236 - ""macroautophagy""
- And many more specific child terms

**What affects the count:**
- The number varies by organism (human, mouse, yeast, etc.)
- It depends on whether you count direct annotations only or include annotations to child terms
- The number grows over time as more research is published and genes are annotated

**Approximate scale:**
Based on my training knowledge, there are typically **hundreds to thousands** of genes annotated with autophagy-related GO terms across model organisms, with the exact number depending on the factors above.

For the most current and accurate count, you would need to:
1. Query the Gene Ontology database directly (geneontology.org)
2. Specify which organism(s) you're interested in
3. Decide whether to include only direct annotations or all descendant terms

**Important note:** In Gene Ontology analyses, it's common practice to include not just the specific term but also all its descendant (child) terms. The autophagy term has 25 descendant terms including:
- **Macroautophagy** (GO:0016236) and its subtypes like mitophagy, pexophagy, lipophagy, etc.

1. **Coverage**: About 1 in 4 Rhea reactions are annotated with GO molecular function terms, which represents substantial but not complete coverage.

2. **Near-complete molecular function representation**: Almost all reactions with GO annotations (4,429 out of 4,436) have molecular function terms specifically, which makes sense since Rhea describes biochemical reactions that correspond closely to molecular function concepts.

3. **Integration pathway**: According to the Rhea database documentation, these GO molecular function annotations provide connections between biochemical reaction chemistry and standardized functional descriptions used in gene/protein annotation, particularly valuable for linking to UniProt enzyme data.

- **Location**: Chromosome 17q21.31

### **Primary Associated Disease Conditions**

The pathogenic BRCA1 variants are primarily associated with:

1. **Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC)**
   - Most common association
   - Also called: Familial breast-ovarian cancer syndrome
   - OMIM ID: 604370

2. **Breast-Ovarian Cancer, Familial, Susceptibility to, 1**
   - Hereditary breast cancer
   - Familial breast cancer (OMIM: 114480)

3. **Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility**

4. **Fanconi Anemia, Complementation Group S**
   - Less common association
   - Related to DNA repair deficiency

### **Types of Pathogenic Variants Found**

From the ClinVar database, I identified multiple types of pathogenic variants in BRCA1:

#### **1. Frameshift Variants (Most Common)**
- **c.2244dup (p.Asp749fs)** - Duplication, Pathogenic
- **c.1997del (p.Leu666fs)** - Deletion, Pathogenic
- **c.945del (p.Ser316fs)** - Deletion, Pathogenic
- **c.3815dup (p.Asn1272fs)** - Duplication, Pathogenic
- **c.1673_1674del (p.Lys558fs)** - Deletion, Pathogenic
- **c.1716del (p.Glu572fs)** - Deletion, Pathogenic
- **c.1729_1730del (p.Glu577fs)** - Deletion, Pathogenic

#### **2. Nonsense Variants (Stop Codons)**
- **c.1576C>T (p.Gln526Ter)** - Pathogenic
- **c.1600C>T (p.Gln534Ter)** - Pathogenic
- **c.160C>T (p.Gln54Ter)** - Pathogenic
- **c.1612C>T (p.Gln538Ter)** - Pathogenic
- **c.1630C>T (p.Gln544Ter)** - Pathogenic
- **c.2593A>T (p.Lys865Ter)** - Pathogenic
- **c.4523G>A (p.Trp1508Ter)** - Pathogenic

#### **3. Large Deletions**
- **c.5333-1_5406+1del** - Exon deletion, Pathogenic
- Multiple genomic deletions involving multiple exons

#### **4. Insertion Variants**
- **c.2940_2941insNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN (p.Pro981fs)** - Pathogenic

#### **5. Missense Variants**
- **c.181T>C (p.Cys61Arg)** - Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic
- **c.182G>A (p.Cys61Tyr)** - Pathogenic

### **Clinical Significance Classifications**

The variants are classified as:
- **Pathogenic**: Clear evidence of disease-causing potential
- **Likely Pathogenic**: Strong evidence but not conclusive
- **Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic**: Multiple submissions with slight variation
- **Conflicting Classifications**: Some variants have conflicting evidence

### **Key Clinical Implications**

1. **Cancer Risk**: Women with pathogenic BRCA1 variants have significantly elevated lifetime risks:
   - Breast cancer: 55-72%
   - Ovarian cancer: 39-44%

2. **Inheritance**: Autosomal dominant pattern

3. **Clinical Management**: Carriers typically undergo enhanced surveillance, risk-reducing surgeries, or targeted therapies (PARP inhibitors)

4. **Variant Types**: Loss-of-function variants (frameshift, nonsense, large deletions) are most commonly pathogenic, while missense variants often have uncertain or conflicting classifications

## Distribution of BRCA1 Variant Types in ClinVar

Based on the current ClinVar database, there are **14,835 BRCA1 variants** with the following distribution by variant type:

### Variant Type Distribution

| Variant Type | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Single nucleotide variant** | 11,150 | 75.2% |
| **Deletion** | 2,108 | 14.2% |
| **Duplication** | 712 | 4.8% |

| **Protein only** | 30 | 0.2% |
| **Inversion** | 4 | <0.1% |
| **Haplotype** | 3 | <0.1% |

### Key Findings:

1. **Single nucleotide variants (SNVs)** are by far the most common type, accounting for **over 75%** of all BRCA1 variants in ClinVar.

2. **Structural variants** (Deletions, Duplications, Insertions, Indels) collectively represent about **23%** of BRCA1 variants, with deletions being the most common structural variant type.

3. **Rare variant types** like inversions and haplotypes represent less than 0.1% of all variants.

## Major GO Molecular Functions with EC Numbers:

1. **Oxidoreductases (EC 1.-)** - catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions
   - Examples: dehydrogenases, oxidases, peroxidases, reductases

2. **Transferases (EC 2.-)** - transfer functional groups between molecules
   - Examples: kinases, methyltransferases, glycosyltransferases, aminotransferases

3. **Hydrolases (EC 3.-)** - catalyze hydrolysis reactions
   - Examples: proteases, lipases, phosphatases, nucleases, esterases

4. **Lyases (EC 4.-)** - cleave bonds by means other than hydrolysis
   - Examples: decarboxylases, aldolases, dehydratases

5. **Isomerases (EC 5.-)** - catalyze isomerization reactions
   - Examples: racemases, epimerases, mutases

6. **Ligases (EC 6.-)** - catalyze bond formation coupled with ATP hydrolysis
   - Examples: synthetases, carboxylases, DNA ligase, aminoacyl-tRNA ligases

7. **Translocases (EC 7.-)** - catalyze movement of ions or molecules across membranes
   - Examples: various transporters and channels with catalytic activity

## Key Points:
- GO molecular function terms for catalytic activities are often cross-referenced with their corresponding EC numbers
- The EC number provides a systematic classification of the enzyme's catalytic mechanism
- Not all GO molecular functions have EC numbers - only those describing catalytic/enzymatic activities",,8.515615940093994,49,417,True,True,0.5555555555555556,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about GO molecular functions with EC numbers. Let me provide a clear summary to the user.

### **Key Insights:**

1. **Therapeutic Diversity**: GPCR antagonists are used across many therapeutic areas including psychiatry, cardiology, allergy, pain management, and oncology.

2. **Drug Development**: Many of these compounds are FDA-approved drugs, while others (like GSK163090, LY2590443, PF-05212377) are experimental compounds tested in clinical trials.

3. **Polypharmacology**: Several compounds (e.g., Chlorprothixene, GSK163090) act as antagonists at multiple GPCR subtypes, demonstrating the complexity of drug-receptor interactions.

4. **Research Focus**: The data shows extensive research on aminergic GPCRs (dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic, histamine receptors), reflecting their importance in CNS and cardiovascular disorders.

This represents a substantial portion of modern pharmacology, as GPCRs are the targets of approximately 30-40% of all approved drugs.",,108.72794795036316,43,4865,26835,260466,"mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_target, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_target, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_target,

2. **Lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765)** - Defects here can affect substrate transport and lysosomal integrity

3. **Lysosomal lumen (GO:0043202)** - Where most hydrolytic enzymes function and substrates accumulate

## Related Components:

4. **Vacuolar membrane (GO:0005774)** - In yeast models, equivalent to lysosomal membrane

5. **Endosome (GO:0005768)** - Part of the endolysosomal pathway; early and late endosomes are involved in trafficking to lysosomes

## Primary Lysosomal Components

**1. Lysosome (GO:0005764)**
- The main organelle affected in lysosomal storage diseases
- A small lytic vacuole containing hydrolases that function optimally at pH 5-6
- Contains about 40 different lysosomal hydrolases

**2. Lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765)**
- The lipid bilayer surrounding the lysosome
- Separates lysosomal contents from the cell cytoplasm
- Critical for maintaining lysosomal integrity and function

**3. Lysosomal lumen (GO:0043202)**
- The internal volume enclosed within the lysosomal membrane
- Where material accumulation occurs in storage diseases

## Specialized Lysosomal Subtypes

**4. Primary lysosome (GO:0005766)**
- Lysosome before fusion with other vesicles/vacuoles

**5. Secondary lysosome (GO:0005767)**
- Forms after fusion with organelles or phagosomes
- Includes subtypes:
  - **Autolysosome (GO:0044754)** - fuses with autophagosomes for autophagy
  - **Phagolysosome (GO:0032010)** - fuses with phagosomes

**6. Endolysosome (GO:0036019)**
- Transient hybrid organelle formed by fusion of late endosome with lysosome
- Site of active degradation

- Supramolecular assemblies of lysosomal enzymes and lipids at pH 5.0

**8. BORC complex (GO:0099078)**
- Protein complex involved in lysosome positioning within the cytoplasm
- Recruits ARL8 to couple lysosomes to kinesin motors

These cellular components are directly relevant to lysosomal storage diseases because:
- **Defects in lysosomal enzymes** lead to accumulation of undegraded material in the lysosomal lumen
- **Membrane protein defects** can affect substrate transport
- **Impaired autophagy** (autolysosome dysfunction) contributes to disease pathology
- **Trafficking defects** can prevent proper enzyme delivery to lysosomes

2. **p.Arg555=** (c.1665A>G) - Likely benign (synonymous)

### Clinical Variant Example

According to a recent case report from PubMed, a Japanese man was diagnosed with CF due to a **homozygous c.1210-11 T>G variant** in the CFTR gene, which manifested as congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) and recurrent pancreatitis ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1002/rmb2.70018)).

### Treatment Advances

According to PubMed research, **CFTR modulators** represent a therapeutic revolution for cystic fibrosis. These drugs bind to the CFTR protein to improve its function and are now available for more than 85% of patients. The effectiveness depends on which specific variants patients carry ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12551-025-01350-6)).

The variants cause different molecular consequences including:
- Missense variants (amino acid substitutions)
- Deletions (like F508del)
- Splice site variants
- Synonymous variants (usually benign)

85,2026-01-31,Structured Query,What reactions convert ATP to ADP during phosphate transfer?,True,True,True,0.6666666666666666,"ATP is converted to ADP during phosphate transfer through **phosphorylation reactions** (also called **phosphoryl transfer reactions**). Here are the main types:

## 1. **Substrate-Level Phosphorylation**
Direct transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a substrate molecule:
- **Kinase reactions** - enzymes called kinases catalyze phosphate transfer to various molecules
- Example: Hexokinase transfers phosphate from ATP to glucose, forming glucose-6-phosphate + ADP

## 2. **Protein Phosphorylation**
Transfer of phosphate to proteins for regulatory purposes:
- Protein kinases phosphorylate serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues
- Example: Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates target proteins in signaling cascades

## 3. **Coupled Reactions**
ATP hydrolysis coupled to energy-requiring processes:
- **Motor proteins** (myosin, kinesin) - ATP → ADP powers movement
- **Active transport pumps** (Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase) - uses ATP → ADP to pump ions against gradients
- **DNA/RNA synthesis** - though these use ATP → AMP + PPi primarily

## General Mechanism
The typical reaction is:
**ATP + Substrate → ADP + Phosphorylated-Substrate**

The terminal (gamma) phosphate of ATP is transferred, leaving ADP. This reaction is thermodynamically favorable (releases energy) and is used to drive otherwise unfavorable cellular processes.

These reactions are fundamental to metabolism, cell signaling, biosynthesis, and mechanical work in cells.",,9.91650390625,49,383,True,True,0.6666666666666666,"Based on my search of the Rhea biochemical reactions database, I found numerous reactions that convert ATP to ADP during phosphate transfer. These reactions fall into several major categories:

## Main Types of ATP → ADP Phosphate Transfer Reactions:

### 1. **Protein Phosphorylation (Kinases)**
These reactions phosphorylate amino acid residues on proteins:
- **Serine phosphorylation**: e.g., RHEA:18673 - phosphorylation of receptor proteins
- **Threonine phosphorylation**: e.g., RHEA:11424 - phosphorylation of myosin heavy chain
- **Histidine phosphorylation**: e.g., RHEA:11860 - phosphorylation of histidyl-proteins
- **Tyrosine phosphorylation**: Various protein kinase reactions

### 2. **Nucleotide Phosphorylation**
ATP phosphorylates nucleotide monophosphates to diphosphates:
- **RHEA:12973**: AMP + ATP → 2 ADP (adenylate kinase)
- **RHEA:11600**: CMP + ATP → CDP + ADP
- **RHEA:20780**: GMP + ATP → GDP + ADP
- **RHEA:12697**: dGMP + ATP → dGDP + ADP
- **RHEA:13517**: dTMP + ATP → dTDP + ADP

### 3. **Nucleoside Phosphorylation**
Converting nucleosides to nucleotide monophosphates:
- **RHEA:20824**: adenosine + ATP → AMP + ADP
- **RHEA:16825**: uridine + ATP → UMP + ADP
- **RHEA:19129**: thymidine + ATP → dTMP + ADP
- **RHEA:19201**: 2'-deoxyguanosine + ATP → dGMP + ADP

### 4. **Lipid Phosphorylation**
Phosphorylating various lipids:
- **RHEA:10272**: diacylglycerol → phosphatidate (diacylglycerol kinase)
- **RHEA:12280**: PI5P → PIP2 (phosphoinositide kinases)
- **RHEA:21292**: PIP2 → PIP3 (PI3-kinase reaction)

### 5. **Inositol Phosphate Phosphorylation**
Multiple reactions adding phosphates to inositol derivatives:
- **RHEA:11020**: IP3 → IP4
- **RHEA:20313**: IP5 → IP6 (phytic acid synthesis)

Now I have comprehensive information about all subtypes of autophagy in Gene Ontology. Let me compile this into a clear and organized summary for you.

## Autophagy Subtypes in Gene Ontology

Based on the Gene Ontology database, autophagy (GO:0006914) has multiple distinct subtypes, each with specialized functions. Here's a comprehensive overview:

### **Main Categories of Autophagy**

#### **1. Macroautophagy (GO:0016236)**
The autophagic process that proceeds via the formation of an autophagosome (a double-membrane vesicle).

**Specialized Macroautophagy Subtypes:**

- **Mitophagy (GO:0000423)** - Selective degradation of mitochondria
  - *Type 1 Mitophagy (GO:0180045)* - Degradation of functional mitochondria during nutrient deprivation or to remove excess mitochondria
  - *Type 2 Mitophagy (GO:0061734)* - Degradation of damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria initiated by depolarization and Parkin binding

- **Pexophagy (GO:0000425)** - Selective degradation of peroxisomes

- **Reticulophagy (GO:0061709)** - Selective degradation of endoplasmic reticulum parts

- **Ribophagy (GO:0034517)** - Selective degradation of mature ribosomes

- **Lipophagy (GO:0061724)** - Selective degradation of lipid droplets

- **Glycophagy (GO:0061723)** - Selective degradation of glycogen

- **Aggrephagy (GO:0035973)** - Selective degradation of protein aggregates

- **Nucleophagy (GO:0044804)** - Degradation of damaged or non-essential parts of the nucleus

- **Xenophagy (GO:0098792)** - Selective degradation of intracellular pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viral capsids)

- **Lysophagy (GO:0062093)** - Selective degradation of damaged lysosomes

- **Proteaphagy (GO:0061816)** - Selective degradation of proteasomes

#### **2. Microautophagy (GO:0016237)**
Autophagy where cytosolic components are directly engulfed by lysosomes/vacuoles through membrane invagination, without forming an autophagosome first.

**Microautophagy Subtypes:**

- **Micropexophagy (GO:0000426)** - Degradation of peroxisomes by microautophagy

- **Micromitophagy (GO:0000424)** - Degradation of mitochondria by microautophagy

- **Piecemeal Microautophagy of the Nucleus (GO:0034727)** - Degradation of nuclear components by microautophagy

- **Late Endosomal Microautophagy (GO:0061738)** - Chaperone-tagged proteins are directly transferred into and degraded in late endosomes

- **Microlipophagy (GO:0140504)** - Degradation of lipid droplets by microautophagy

#### **3. Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy (GO:0061684)**
Process where chaperones recognize a target motif, unfold substrate proteins, and transport them to lysosomes for degradation (no vesicle formation).

#### **4. Other Specialized Types:**

- **Crinophagy (GO:0160155)** - Direct fusion of abnormal, excess, or obsolete secretory granules with lysosomes; maintains homeostasis in endocrine and exocrine cells

- **Mitophagy by Internal Vacuole Formation (GO:0035695)** - Mitochondria are directly engulfed by lysosome-like vacuoles (distinct from canonical autophagy)

### **Key Functional Distinctions**

1. **Nutrient Response**: Types like Type 1 mitophagy and glycophagy provide metabolic precursors during starvation

2. **Quality Control**: Type 2 mitophagy, lysophagy, and aggrephagy remove damaged or dysfunctional cellular components

3. **Pathogen Defense**: Xenophagy eliminates intracellular pathogens

4. **Homeostasis**: Crinophagy maintains proper levels of secretory granules

5. **Metabolic Regulation**: Lipophagy and glycophagy regulate energy storage and utilization

93,2026-01-31,Currency,What experimental methods have been used to determine BRCA1 protein structures?,True,True,True,1.0,"Based on my training knowledge, several experimental methods have been used to determine BRCA1 protein structures:

## X-ray Crystallography
This has been the primary method for determining BRCA1 domain structures:
- **RING domain** - Structures of the BRCA1 RING domain in complex with BARD1 RING domain have been solved, revealing their heterodimeric E3 ubiquitin ligase structure
- **BRCT domains** - The tandem BRCT repeats at the C-terminus have been crystallized, both alone and in complex with phosphopeptides, revealing how they recognize phosphorylated binding partners

## Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy
NMR has been used to study:
- Individual BRCA1 domains in solution
- Domain dynamics and interactions with peptides
- Some structural characterization of smaller BRCA1 fragments

## Challenges and Limitations
It's important to note that:
- **No full-length structure exists** - BRCA1 is a large (1863 amino acids), multi-domain protein that has been difficult to express and purify in full-length form
- **Only individual domains solved** - Structural information is limited to isolated domains (RING, BRCT) or domain complexes
- The central region of BRCA1 remains largely unstructured or poorly characterized structurally

## More Recent Approaches
Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) may have been applied to larger BRCA1-containing complexes, though my knowledge of specific applications is limited.

The lack of a complete BRCA1 structure reflects technical challenges common to large, multi-domain proteins with intrinsically disordered regions.",,10.625468015670776,53,397,True,True,1.0,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about the experimental methods used to determine BRCA1 protein structures. Let me provide you with a detailed summary.

## Experimental Methods Used to Determine BRCA1 Protein Structures

Based on the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database, **three main experimental methods** have been used to determine BRCA1 protein structures:

### 1. **X-ray Crystallography (X-RAY DIFFRACTION)** - Most Common Method
This is by far the most widely used method, accounting for the majority of BRCA1 structures. Key structures include:

- **BRCT Domain Studies**: The tandem BRCT (BRCA1 C-Terminal) repeats have been extensively studied, including:
  - First structure of BRCT repeats (1JNX, 2001)
  - BRCT domains bound to phosphorylated peptides from binding partners (BACH1, CtIP, Abraxas, ACC1, ATRIP, BAAT)
  - Disease-causing mutations and variants
  - Minimal recognition motifs

- **Examples**: 1JNX, 1T15, 1Y98, 4JLU, 4Y18, and many others (~30+ structures)

### 2. **Solution NMR Spectroscopy (SOLUTION NMR)**
Used for smaller domains and flexible regions:

- **RING Domain**: Structure of BRCA1/BARD1 RING-domain heterodimer (1JM7)
- **BRCT Domains**: Individual BRCT-c domain (1OQA)
- **Coiled-coil Region**: BRCA1-PALB2 heterodimer (7K3S, 2021)

These NMR structures provide insights into solution-state dynamics and flexibility.

### 3. **Cryo-Electron Microscopy (ELECTRON MICROSCOPY)** - Recent Advances
The newest method, primarily used since 2020 for large complexes:

- **BRCA1-BARD1 on nucleosomes** (7JZV, 7LYB, 8GRQ, 2020-2022): Shows how BRCA1 functions in chromatin context
- **BRCA1 recruitment to damaged chromatin** (7E8I)
- **ACC-BRCT filaments** (6G2H, 6G2I): Large filamentous assemblies

Cryo-EM has been crucial for understanding BRCA1 in its functional context with nucleosomes and other large complexes.

### Summary
The progression of methods reflects technological advances: X-ray crystallography dominated early structural studies (2001-2020s), NMR provided complementary solution-state information, and cryo-EM has recently enabled visualization of BRCA1 in complex with nucleosomes and chromatin—critical for understanding its DNA repair functions.",,37.72014999389648,16,1269,4403,80891,"mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""BRCA1 human"", ""limit"": 5}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity"", ""input"": {""db"": ""pdb"", ""query"": ""BRCA1"", ""limit"": 30}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""pdb"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX PDBo: <http://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>\nPREFIX dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?pdbid ?method ?title\nWHERE {\n  ?entry a PDBo:datablock ;\n         dc:title ?title ;\n         PDBo:has_exptlCategory ?exptl .\n  ?exptl PDBo:has_exptl ?exptl_details .\n  ?exptl_details PDBo:exptl.method ?method .\n  \n  BIND(STRAFTER(STR(?entry), \""http://rdf.wwpdb.org/pdb/\"") AS ?pdbid)\n  \n  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?title), \""brca1\""))\n}\nORDER BY ?pdbid\nLIMIT 50""}}]",VALUABLE,"X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy have been used for BRCA1 structures","COMPLEX QUERY requiring cross-reference and method knowledge.

## Gene Functions Associated with the Insulin Signaling Pathway

The insulin signaling pathway (GO:0008286) is defined as ""the series of molecular signals generated as a consequence of the insulin receptor binding to insulin."" This pathway is classified as a **cell surface receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway** and plays crucial roles in glucose metabolism, cell growth, and survival.

### Key Genes and Their Functions:

#### **1. Insulin Receptor (INSR/IR)**
- **UniProt ID**: P06213 (human)
- **Function**: Receptor tyrosine kinase (EC 2.7.10.1)
- **Role**: Binds insulin and initiates the signaling cascade through autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues
- **Structure**: Processed into alpha and beta subunits; the beta subunit contains the tyrosine kinase domain

#### **2. Insulin Receptor Substrates (IRS proteins)**
- **IRS1** (UniProt: P35568)
  - Functions as the primary adapter protein
  - Phosphorylated by the insulin receptor on multiple tyrosine residues
  - Creates docking sites for downstream signaling molecules
- **IRS2** - Similar function to IRS1, involved in metabolic regulation

#### **3. PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase) Pathway Components**
- **PIK3CA/PIK3CB** - Catalytic subunits
  - **Function**: Lipid kinase (EC 2.7.1.137) that phosphorylates PIP2 to generate PIP3
  - **Role**: Central mediator of insulin's metabolic effects
  
#### **4. AKT/PKB (Protein Kinase B)**
- **AKT1, AKT2, AKT3**
- **Function**: Serine/threonine protein kinase
- **Role**: Key effector kinase that mediates:
  - Glucose uptake (via GLUT4 translocation)
  - Glycogen synthesis
  - Protein synthesis
  - Cell survival and proliferation

#### **5. DAF-16/FOXO Transcription Factors**
- **Function**: Transcription factors regulated by AKT phosphorylation
- **Role**: When dephosphorylated, translocate to nucleus to regulate:
  - Stress resistance
  - Longevity
  - Metabolic gene expression

### Pathway Regulation:

**Positive Regulation (GO:0046628):**
- Processes that increase insulin receptor signaling
- Includes receptor internalization for signal amplification
- Enhanced phosphorylation cascades

**Negative Regulation (GO:0046627):**
- Receptor internalization and degradation
- Protein tyrosine phosphatases
- Feedback inhibition mechanisms

### Biological Processes Controlled:

1. **Glucose Metabolism**: Glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, gluconeogenesis inhibition
2. **Lipid Metabolism**: Lipogenesis, fatty acid synthesis
3. **Protein Synthesis**: mTOR pathway activation
4. **Cell Growth and Proliferation**: Via MAPK/ERK pathway
5. **Cell Survival**: Anti-apoptotic signaling
6. **Aging and Longevity**: Regulation of lifespan through DAF-16/FOXO

### Recent Research Findings:

According to PubMed, recent research has revealed connections between insulin signaling and other cellular processes. For example, a 2026 study ([DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.5c17589](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5c17589)) identified a mechanistic link between the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and ferroptosis (iron-dependent cell death), showing that the **DAF-2-AGE-1-PDK-1-AKT-DAF-16** axis serves as a central regulatory pathway connecting metabolic signaling to cellular stress responses.

### Cross-Species Conservation:

The insulin signaling pathway is highly conserved across species:
- **Mammals** (human, mouse, rat): Complete pathway with insulin and IGF receptors
- **C. elegans**: DAF-2 (insulin/IGF receptor ortholog)
- **Drosophila**: InR (insulin receptor) and chico (IRS ortholog)

This pathway's evolutionary conservation highlights its fundamental importance in regulating metabolism, growth, and aging across diverse organisms.",,84.24534010887146,42,3044,44657,353209,"mcp__ols__search, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__ols__fetch, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__ols__searchClasses, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity","[{""name"": ""mcp__ols__search"", ""input"": {""query"": ""insulin signaling pathway""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""insulin signaling pathway"", ""rows"": 10}}, {""name"": ""mcp__ols__fetch"", ""input"": {""id"": ""go+http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0008286""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX bp: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\nPREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?proteinName ?uniprotId ?pathwayName\nFROM <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/reactome>\nWHERE {\n  ?pathway a bp:Pathway ;\n           bp:displayName ?pathwayName ;\n           bp:organism ?org ;\n           bp:pathwayComponent*/bp:left|bp:right ?protein .\n  ?org bp:name \""Homo sapiens\"" .\n  ?protein a bp:Protein ;\n           bp:entityReference ?proteinRef .\n  ?proteinRef bp:name ?proteinName ;\n              bp:xref ?xref .\n  ?xref a bp:UnificationXref ;\n        bp:db \""UniProt\""^^xsd:string ;\n        bp:id ?uniprotId .\n  ?pathwayName bif:contains \""'insulin' AND 'signaling'\"" option (score ?sc)\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?sc)\nLIMIT 50""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX bp: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?pathway ?pathwayName\nFROM <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/reactome>\nWHERE {\n  ?pathway a bp:Pathway ;\n           bp:displayName ?pathwayName .\n  ?pathwayName bif:contains \""'insulin'\"" option (score ?sc)\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?sc)\nLIMIT 20""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__pubmed__search_articles"", ""input"": {""query"": ""insulin signaling pathway genes molecular function"", ""max_results"": 5}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""reactome"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX bp: <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#>\nPREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?proteinName ?uniprotId\nFROM <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/reactome>\nWHERE {\n  ?pathway a bp:Pathway ;\n           bp:displayName \""Insulin receptor signalling cascade\"" ;\n           bp:pathwayComponent*/bp:left|bp:right ?entity .\n  ?entity bp:entityReference ?ref .\n  ?ref bp:name ?proteinName ;\n       bp:xref ?xref .\n  ?xref a bp:UnificationXref ;\n        bp:db \""UniProt\""^^xsd:string ;\n        bp:id ?uniprotId .\n}\nLIMIT 50""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__ols__searchClasses"", ""input"": {""query"": ""insulin receptor signaling pathway"", ""ontologyId"": ""go"", ""pageSize"": 20}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""go"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX obo: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?gene ?geneLabel ?function\nWHERE {\n  ?gene rdf:type ?type ;\n        rdfs:label ?geneLabel .\n  ?annotation rdf:type ?annotationType ;\n              ?relatesTo <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0008286> ;\n              ?hasGene ?gene .\n  OPTIONAL {\n    ?gene ?hasProp ?function .\n  }\n}\nLIMIT 50""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata"", ""input"": {""pmids"": [""41616222""]}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""insulin receptor"", ""limit"": 10}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""IRS1 insulin receptor substrate"", ""limit"": 5}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""PI3K phosphoinositide 3-kinase"", ""limit"": 5}}]",CRITICAL,GO molecular functions and biological processes related to insulin signaling,"COMPLEX QUERY requiring pathway-GO integration.

   - Publications in journals not indexed by PubMed
   - Non-English language publications
   - Theses or dissertations

3. **The fraction has increased over time**: More recent PDB depositions are more likely to have associated PubMed IDs as deposition policies have become more standardized.

However, I can tell you that:

1. **Most PDB structures have UniProt cross-references** - The vast majority of protein structures in the PDB are linked to UniProt entries, as UniProt is the primary protein sequence database.

2. **The number is in the millions** - Since there are over 200,000 structures in the PDB (as of recent years), and many structures contain multiple protein chains, each potentially having UniProt cross-references, the total number of cross-references would be substantial.

3. **One structure can have multiple cross-references** - A single PDB entry often contains multiple protein chains, and each chain typically has its own UniProt cross-reference.

This includes:
- **Distinct UniProt accessions: 64,444** unique proteins
- **Total cross-reference records: 352,114** (across all PDB structures)

2. **High representation**: According to the PDB metadata, UniProt cross-references represent approximately **172% coverage** per PDB entry on average, which makes sense because:
   - Most structures contain multiple protein chains
   - Many structures include protein complexes with multiple UniProt entries
   - Popular proteins (like antibodies, kinases) appear in hundreds of structures

103,2026-01-31,Specificity,What gene types are represented in ClinVar's gene database and how do they link to NCBI Gene?,True,True,True,1.0,"Based on my training knowledge of ClinVar's structure:

## Gene Types in ClinVar

ClinVar includes several types of genes in its database:

1. **Protein-coding genes** - The most common type
2. **Non-coding RNA genes** - Including:
   - microRNAs (miRNA)
   - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA)
   - Small nuclear RNAs (snRNA)
   - Transfer RNAs (tRNA)
3. **Pseudogenes** - Non-functional gene copies
4. **Other gene types** - Various regulatory and structural elements

## Link to NCBI Gene

ClinVar is tightly integrated with NCBI's Gene database through:

1. **Gene IDs**: Each gene in ClinVar is linked via a unique NCBI Gene ID (also called Entrez Gene ID or GeneID), which serves as the primary identifier

2. **Cross-referencing**: Variants in ClinVar are mapped to their corresponding genes using these Gene IDs, allowing users to:
   - Navigate from variant records to comprehensive gene information
   - Access gene summaries, genomic context, and expression data
   - View all variants associated with a particular gene

3. **Data synchronization**: ClinVar uses NCBI Gene's official gene symbols, names, and annotations to maintain consistency across NCBI databases

4. **Genomic coordinates**: The relationship is maintained through genomic positions on reference assemblies (like GRCh37/GRCh38), ensuring variants are correctly associated with their genes

This integration allows ClinVar to leverage NCBI Gene's comprehensive gene information while focusing on clinical variant interpretation.",,9.289912700653076,60,378,True,True,0.7,"Based on my investigation of ClinVar's gene database and its relationship to NCBI Gene, here's what I found:

## Gene Types in ClinVar's Database

ClinVar's gene database primarily contains **one main gene type**, but it's represented through two RDF class types:

1. **`cvo:Gene`** - The ClinVar-specific gene class (~5 million triples)
2. **`med2rdf:Gene`** - The Med2RDF ontology gene class (also ~5 million triples)

Both types refer to the same gene entities - ClinVar genes are dual-typed with both classes to support interoperability.

## Gene Properties in ClinVar

The genes in ClinVar contain rich metadata with these properties (in order of prevalence):
- **Symbol** (~5M entries) - Gene symbols like ""BRCA1""
- **Genomic locations** (~2.7M) - FALDO-based coordinates
- **Gene ID** (~92K) - NCBI Gene identifiers
- **Full name** (~93K) - Complete gene names
- **Cytogenetic location** (~92K) - Chromosomal locations
- **HGNC IDs** (~28K) - Human Gene Nomenclature Committee identifiers
- **OMIM IDs** (~17K) - Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man identifiers
- **Clinical curation scores** - Triplosensitivity and haploinsufficiency (~218K each)

## How ClinVar Links to NCBI Gene

ClinVar connects to NCBI Gene through **multiple pathways**:

### 1. **Direct ID-based Linking**
- ClinVar genes have a `cvo:gene_id` property containing NCBI Gene IDs
- Example: BRCA1 has `cvo:gene_id` = 672
- The gene URI follows the pattern: `http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/{id}`

### 2. **Variant-to-Gene Associations**
- Variants in ClinVar link to genes through a complex path:
  - `Variant` → `cvo:classified_record` → `ClassifiedRecord`
  - `ClassifiedRecord` → `sio:SIO_000628` → Gene blank node
  - Gene blank node → `med2rdf:gene` → Gene URI (`http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/{id}`)

### 3. **TogoID Cross-Reference System**
According to TogoID, ClinVar variants can be converted to NCBI Gene IDs with the relationship:
- **Forward**: ""is located in"" (ClinVar variant → NCBI Gene)
- **Reverse**: ""has variant"" (NCBI Gene → ClinVar variant)
- Relationship ID: TIO_000062/TIO_000063

### 4. **External Cross-References**
ClinVar genes also link to:
- **HGNC** (Human Gene Nomenclature Committee) for standardized human gene symbols
- **OMIM** for Mendelian disease genes
- **UniProt** for protein products
- **Ensembl Gene** for additional genomic annotations

## Example Workflow

To trace from a ClinVar variant to NCBI Gene:
```
ClinVar Variant (VCV000856461) 
  ↓ [cvo:classified_record]
ClassifiedRecord 
  ↓ [sio:SIO_000628]
Gene Blank Node 
  ↓ [med2rdf:gene]
NCBI Gene URI (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/672)
  ↓ [matched with cvo:gene_id]
ClinVar Gene Entity (cvo:Gene) with symbol ""BRCA1""
```

## **Major Classes of Agonist Drugs for Metabolic Disorders**

### **1. GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1)**
These are among the most transformative medications for metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes and obesity:

**Available drugs include:**
- **Semaglutide** (Ozempic, Wegovy) - Weekly injection
- **Liraglutide** (Victoza, Saxenda) - Daily injection
- **Dulaglutide** (Trulicity) - Weekly injection
- **Exenatide** (Byetta, Bydureon) - Twice daily or weekly

**Benefits:**
- Excellent glycemic control in type 2 diabetes
- Significant weight loss (5-15% body weight reduction)
- Low risk of hypoglycemia
- Cardiovascular protection (reduced risk of heart attack, stroke, cardiovascular death)
- Kidney protection (reduced albuminuria, slower decline in kidney function)
- According to recent research, [liraglutide may even reduce intestinal obstruction risk](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms27020608)

### **2. Dual GIP/GLP-1 Receptor Agonists**
**Tirzepatide** (Mounjaro, Zepbound) is the most notable:
- Activates both GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and GLP-1 receptors
- [Shows superior efficacy compared to single receptor agonists](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-025-00681-5) for:
  - Greater weight loss (up to 20-25% body weight)
  - Better glycemic control
  - Improved body composition (reduced visceral fat)
  - Benefits for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
  - Improvements in fatty liver disease
  - Symptomatic relief in obstructive sleep apnea and knee osteoarthritis

### **3. PPAR Agonists (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor)**
These improve insulin sensitivity:
- **Pioglitazone** (Actos) - PPAR-gamma agonist for type 2 diabetes
- **Rosiglitazone** (Avandia) - Less commonly used due to cardiovascular concerns
- Benefits: Improved insulin sensitivity, reduced inflammation, may help with fatty liver disease

### **4. SGLT2 Inhibitors (Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2)**
While technically not ""agonists,"" they work synergistically with agonist therapies:
- Examples: Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin
- [Often used in combination with GLP-1 agonists for ""diabesity""](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-025-00681-5)

## **Emerging Therapies**

According to [recent research](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)02105-1), next-generation medications in development include:

1. **Triple receptor agonists** (GIP-GLP-1-Glucagon) - Promise even greater weight loss efficacy
2. **Dual GLP-1/Glucagon agonists** - Enhanced metabolic benefits
3. **Dual GLP-1/Amylin agonists** - Additional appetite suppression
4. **Small-molecule oral GLP-1 agonists** - For improved convenience and adherence

## **Clinical Applications**

These agonist drugs are approved or being studied for:
- **Type 2 diabetes** - Primary indication
- **Obesity** - Major new indication
- **Cardiovascular disease prevention** - Proven benefits
- **Chronic kidney disease** - Slows progression
- **Fatty liver disease (MASLD/MASH)** - Regression of steatosis and fibrosis
- **Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction**
- **Potential future uses**: Neurodegenerative diseases, substance use disorders

## **Important Considerations**

- **Side effects**: Common gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain

110,2026-01-31,Structured Query,What NMR structures are available in the PDB and what are their limitations compared to X-ray structures?,True,True,True,0.5555555555555556,"# NMR Structures in the PDB

## Availability and Scale

NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) structures represent a significant but minority portion of the PDB:
- **~10-15%** of total PDB entries are NMR structures
- As of recent years, there are **~13,000-15,000 NMR structures** compared to ~150,000+ X-ray structures
- NMR structures are predominantly of **proteins and nucleic acids**

## Key Limitations of NMR vs X-ray Structures

### 1. **Size Constraints**
- **NMR limitation**: Typically restricted to **<40-50 kDa** for traditional methods
- Modern techniques (TROSY, deuteration) can extend to ~100 kDa, but this is challenging
- **X-ray**: Can handle very large complexes (megadalton assemblies)

### 2. **Resolution and Precision**
- **NMR**: No formal resolution; instead characterized by:
  - Ensemble of structures (typically 10-20 models)
  - Variable precision in different regions
  - Backbone often well-defined, side chains can be less precise
- **X-ray**: Single model with defined resolution (often <2 Å for well-ordered regions)

### 3. **Structural Detail**
- **NMR**: 
  - Lower coordinate precision overall
  - Fewer distance restraints per atom
  - Surface loops often poorly defined
- **X-ray**: Can provide atomic-level detail at high resolution

### 4. **Sample Requirements**
- **NMR**: Requires high concentrations (0.5-2 mM) in solution
- May not work for proteins prone to aggregation
- Limited to soluble proteins

### 5. **Membrane Proteins**
- NMR has historically struggled with membrane proteins (though solid-state NMR is improving)
- X-ray crystallography has been more successful

## Advantages of NMR Structures

Despite limitations, NMR offers unique advantages:
- **Solution conditions**: Structures in native-like environments
- **Dynamics information**: Can capture conformational flexibility
- **No crystallization needed**: Avoids crystal packing artifacts
- **Multiple conformations**: Better represents protein ensembles

The choice between methods depends on the biological question and protein characteristics.",,12.921462059020996,60,542,True,True,0.5555555555555556,"Excellent! The search shows there are **21,366 NMR structures** currently available in the PDB. Now let me provide you with a comprehensive overview of NMR structures and their key differences from X-ray crystallography structures.

## NMR Structures in the PDB

As of the current database, there are **over 21,000 NMR structures** deposited in the PDB, representing a significant but smaller portion compared to X-ray structures (which number over 150,000).

## Key Limitations of NMR Structures Compared to X-ray Structures:

### 1. **Size Limitations**
- **NMR**: Traditionally limited to smaller proteins (<30-40 kDa), though advances with TROSY and deuteration techniques have extended this to ~100 kDa
- **X-ray**: Can handle very large proteins, complexes, and even entire viruses (no practical upper size limit)

### 2. **Resolution**
- **NMR**: Resolution is not defined the same way as in crystallography; structures are represented as ensembles of conformers (typically 10-30 models) reflecting data consistency
- **X-ray**: Provides precise atomic coordinates with defined resolution (often 1.5-3.0 Å or better), with single ""best"" model

### 3. **Structure Precision**
- **NMR**: Variable precision across the molecule; well-defined secondary structures but often poorly defined loop regions; RMSD values indicate coordinate uncertainty
- **X-ray**: Generally uniform precision throughout (where electron density is visible); B-factors indicate atomic displacement

### 4. **Sample Requirements**
- **NMR**: Requires high concentrations (0.5-2 mM), large sample volumes, isotopic labeling (¹⁵N, ¹³C) for larger proteins
- **X-ray**: Requires crystallization, which can be challenging but needs less material once crystals form

### 5. **Time and Data Collection**
- **NMR**: Lengthy data collection (days to weeks) and complex data analysis/structure calculation
- **X-ray**: Faster data collection (minutes to hours with modern synchrotrons), though crystallization can take months

## Advantages of NMR (Why Use It Despite Limitations):

1. **Solution state**: Proteins studied in near-physiological conditions, not constrained by crystal lattice
2. **Dynamics**: Can observe protein flexibility, conformational changes, and dynamics on multiple timescales
3. **No crystallization**: Some proteins that won't crystallize can be studied
4. **Weak interactions**: Better for studying transient complexes and intrinsically disordered proteins
5. **Functional insights**: Can measure binding kinetics, pKa values, and other functional parameters

The examples from the search show typical NMR applications: small protein domains, membrane proteins in micelles, peptides, DNA/RNA structures, and protein-protein/protein-ligand complexes.

Rhea is a comprehensive database of biochemical reactions that uses the Enzyme Commission (EC) classification system. Here's what I know about EC number coverage in Rhea:

## EC Number Structure
EC numbers have a four-level hierarchical classification:
- EC X.-.-..- (Main class: 1-7)
- EC X.Y.-..- (Subclass)
- EC X.Y.Z.- (Sub-subclass)
- EC X.Y.Z.W (Individual enzyme)

## Coverage in Rhea
As of my last training data, Rhea contained:

- **Several thousand distinct EC numbers** - Rhea aims to cover all EC-classified reactions
- **High coverage of characterized enzymes** - particularly those with well-defined reaction mechanisms
- **All 7 main EC classes**:
  1. Oxidoreductases
  2. Transferases
  3. Hydrolases
  4. Lyases
  5. Isomerases
  6. Ligases
  7. Translocases (the newest class, added in 2018)

Rhea's goal is to provide comprehensive coverage of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and it works closely with the UniProt and EC nomenclature committees to ensure broad representation. The database typically covers **~13,000+ reactions** representing **~7,000+ EC numbers**, though exact numbers vary with updates.

However, I should note that these figures may have changed since my training data was last updated, and I recommend checking the current Rhea website or documentation for the most up-to-date statistics.",,9.42030119895935,58,383,True,True,0.7777777777777778,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about EC number coverage in Rhea. Let me provide you with a detailed answer:

## EC Number Coverage in Rhea

Based on my analysis of the Rhea database, here are the key statistics:

### Overall Coverage

- **Distinct EC numbers**: **6,073** unique enzyme classifications are represented in Rhea
- **Reactions with EC annotations**: 7,432 approved reactions out of 16,685 total approved reactions
- **Coverage percentage**: **44.5%** of approved reactions have EC number annotations

### Breakdown by EC Class

The 6,073 EC numbers are distributed across the seven main enzyme classes:

| EC Class | Description | Distinct EC Numbers | Reactions |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **EC 1** | Oxidoreductases | 1,973 | 2,540 |
| **EC 2** | Transferases | 1,960 | 2,383 |
| **EC 3** | Hydrolases | 783 | 979 |
| **EC 4** | Lyases | 737 | 833 |
| **EC 5** | Isomerases | 300 | 338 |
| **EC 6** | Ligases | 237 | 273 |
| **EC 7** | Translocases | 83 | 88 |

### Key Insights

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Rhea has excellent coverage of oxidoreductases (EC 1) and transferases (EC 2), which together represent nearly 65% of all EC numbers in the database.

2. **Translocases**: The newest EC class (EC 7, established in 2018) is represented with 83 distinct entries, showing Rhea's currency with modern enzyme classification.

3. **Multiple Reactions per EC**: Some EC numbers are associated with multiple reactions because Rhea captures different reaction variants (e.g., with different cofactors, substrates, or cellular locations).

4. **Unannotated Reactions**: About 55% of approved reactions don't have EC numbers, which may include transport reactions, spontaneous reactions, or reactions awaiting enzyme characterization.

This makes Rhea one of the most comprehensive repositories for enzyme-catalyzed reactions, with strong integration to the IUBMB enzyme classification system.",,33.161115884780884,21,1448,13346,130029,"mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""rhea""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""rhea"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX rhea: <http://rdf.rhea-db.org/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?ec) as ?distinctEC)\nWHERE {\n  ?reaction rdfs:subClassOf rhea:Reaction ;\n            rhea:status rhea:Approved ;\n            rhea:ec ?ec .\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""rhea"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX rhea: <http://rdf.rhea-db.org/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?reaction) as ?reactionsWithEC)\nWHERE {\n  ?reaction rdfs:subClassOf rhea:Reaction ;\n            rhea:status rhea:Approved ;\n            rhea:ec ?ec .\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""rhea"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX rhea: <http://rdf.rhea-db.org/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?reaction) as ?totalApprovedReactions)\nWHERE {\n  ?reaction rdfs:subClassOf rhea:Reaction ;\n            rhea:status rhea:Approved .\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""rhea"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX rhea: <http://rdf.rhea-db.org/>\n\nSELECT ?ecClass (COUNT(DISTINCT ?ec) as ?distinctEC) (COUNT(DISTINCT ?reaction) as ?reactionCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?reaction rdfs:subClassOf rhea:Reaction ;\n            rhea:status rhea:Approved ;\n            rhea:ec ?ec .\n  BIND(REPLACE(STR(?ec), \""http://purl.uniprot.org/enzyme/(\\\\d+)\\\\..*\"", \""$1\"") AS ?ecClass)\n}\nGROUP BY ?ecClass\nORDER BY ?ecClass\n""}}]",CRITICAL,"6,073 unique EC numbers across 7,432 reactions (44.5% of approved reactions have EC numbers)","COMPLEX QUERY requiring coverage analysis.

## Drugs with Indications for Both Cancer and Cardiovascular Conditions

Based on my search of the ChEMBL database, I've found several drugs with documented indications for both cancer and cardiovascular conditions. Here are the most notable ones:

### **Key Drugs with Dual Indications:**

#### 1. **Aspirin** (23 cancer indications, 15 cardiovascular indications)
- **Cancer indications**: Various cancers including colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, melanoma, leukemia, pancreatic, ovarian cancers
- **Cardiovascular indications**: Acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction (both ST-elevation and non-ST-elevation), coronary artery disease, thrombosis, heart failure, hypertension
- **Clinical relevance**: Used for cancer prevention/treatment and widely used for cardiovascular protection

#### 2. **Metformin** (40 cancer indications, 8 cardiovascular indications)
- **Cancer indications**: Breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, liver, melanoma, various other cancers
- **Cardiovascular indications**: Heart failure, hypertension, acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, coronary disease
