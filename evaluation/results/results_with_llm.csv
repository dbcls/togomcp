BacDive (Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase) is a comprehensive database that integrates various types of strain-linked information, including genome sequences. The database links to genome data from sources like NCBI GenBank/RefSeq and other repositories. However, the number of genome sequences linked to BacDive strains changes regularly as:

1. New genomes are continuously being sequenced and deposited
2. BacDive regularly updates its database with new linkages
3. The curation process is ongoing

To get the current, accurate number, you would need to:
- Visit the BacDive website directly (https://bacdive.dsmz.de/)
- Check their statistics page
- Or query their database/API for the most recent count

The last time I saw references to BacDive statistics, it contained information on tens of thousands of strains, with a substantial portion having linked genome sequence data, but I cannot provide you with a precise current number with certainty.",,8.230595827102661,51,253,True,True,1.0,"Perfect!

## Genome Sequences Linked to BacDive Strains

Based on my query of the BacDive RDF database, here are the statistics for genome sequences:

**Overall Statistics:**
- **17,607 strains** have genome sequence data linked to them
- **50,588 total genome sequences** are available across all strains

**Breakdown by Sequence Database:**

1. **NCBI** - 21,630 genome sequences covering 16,652 strains
2. **PATRIC** - 17,185 genome sequences covering 11,916 strains  
3. **IMG** (Integrated Microbial Genomes) - 11,773 genome sequences covering 10,029 strains

**Key Insights:**
- Some strains have genome sequences available from multiple databases, which is why the total number of sequences (50,588) is higher than the number of unique strains (17,607)
- Out of BacDive's ~97,000 total strain records, approximately **18% have genome sequence data** linked to them
- NCBI is the most common source for genome sequences in BacDive

These genome sequences are cross-referenced with their original database accession numbers, making it easy to retrieve the actual sequence data from the respective databases (NCBI GenBank, PATRIC, or IMG).",,36.34303998947144,26,933,12151,157856,"mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__list_databases"", ""input"": {}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""bacdive""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""bacdive"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX schema: <https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?strain) as ?strains_with_genomes) (COUNT(?genome) as ?total_genomes)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/bacdive>\nWHERE {\n  ?genome a schema:GenomeSequence ;\n          schema:describesStrain ?strain .\n}""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""bacdive"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX schema: <https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/>\n\nSELECT ?seqDB (COUNT(DISTINCT ?strain) as ?strain_count) (COUNT(?genome) as ?genome_count)\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/bacdive>\nWHERE {\n  ?genome a schema:GenomeSequence ;\n          schema:describesStrain ?strain ;\n          schema:fromSequenceDB ?seqDB .\n}\nGROUP BY ?seqDB\nORDER BY DESC(?genome_count)""}}]",CRITICAL,"50,588 genome sequences",Database: BacDive.

However, I can tell you that:

1. **MedGen** is NCBI's database for medical genetics and genomics information that aggregates data from multiple sources
2. **MeSH** is the National Library of Medicine's controlled vocabulary thesaurus
3. MedGen does include cross-references to multiple vocabularies including MeSH, SNOMED CT, OMIM, Orphanet, and others

The number of MedGen concepts with MeSH cross-references would depend on:
- The overlap between genetic/genomic conditions (MedGen's focus) and broader medical terminology (MeSH's scope)
- The date of the data, as both databases are continuously updated

To get the current, accurate count, you would need to query the MedGen database directly or check NCBI's latest statistics on the MedGen website or their FTP site where they provide mapping files between different vocabularies.",,7.509669780731201,51,243,True,False,0.3333333333333333,"Perfect!

To put this in context:
- MedGen contains over 233,000 clinical concepts in total
- According to the documentation, MeSH has approximately 80% coverage in MedGen
- The 17,115 concepts with MeSH cross-references represent about 7.3% of all MedGen concepts

This relatively lower percentage (compared to the stated 80% coverage) might be because:
1. Not all MedGen concepts are appropriate for MeSH mapping (MeSH is specifically for biomedical literature indexing)
2. Some concepts may be too specific or too recent to have MeSH mappings
3.

However, I can tell you that:

1. **BRCA1** (Breast Cancer 1 gene) is known to have multiple protein isoforms due to alternative splicing
2. The canonical/main BRCA1 protein isoform in UniProt is **P38398**
3. BRCA1 typically has several documented isoforms - historically around **3-8 major isoforms** have been characterized, though this can vary depending on the annotation version and criteria used

The exact number you'll find in Ensembl can vary because:
- Ensembl updates its annotations regularly
- Different Ensembl releases may include different numbers of transcripts and their corresponding protein products
- The cross-referencing between Ensembl and UniProt depends on both databases' current states

To get the precise current number, you would need to:
- Visit the Ensembl genome browser
- Search for BRCA1
- Look at the transcript table and check the UniProt/SwissProt cross-references in the protein information

- **21 isoform entries** with identifiers starting with letters like A0A, C, E, G, H, K, and Q, which represent various alternative splice variants and isoforms of BRCA1

The BRCA1 gene has multiple transcripts that encode different protein products, and Ensembl cross-references these to their corresponding UniProt entries.
