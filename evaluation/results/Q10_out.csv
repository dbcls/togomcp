- **21 isoform entries** with identifiers starting with letters like A0A, C, E, G, H, K, and Q, which represent various alternative splice variants and isoforms of BRCA1

The BRCA1 gene has multiple transcripts that encode different protein products, and Ensembl cross-references these to their corresponding UniProt entries. The canonical full-length BRCA1 protein (P38398) is referenced by multiple transcripts, while the other UniProt IDs represent shorter isoforms, alternative splice variants, or protein fragments derived from different BRCA1 transcripts.",,40.59691786766052,27,1331,11199,150604,"mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__togoid_convertId, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""BRCA1 human"", ""limit"": 5}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch"", ""input"": {""database"": ""gene"", ""query"": ""BRCA1 AND human[organism]"", ""max_results"": 1}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__togoid_convertId"", ""input"": {""ids"": ""672"", ""route"": ""ncbigene,ensembl_gene""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""ensembl""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""ensembl"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX terms: <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/terms/ensembl/>\nPREFIX so: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/so#>\nPREFIX obo: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>\nPREFIX taxonomy: <http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?transcript_id ?protein_id ?uniprot\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/ensembl>\nWHERE {\n  ?gene a terms:EnsemblGene ;\n        dcterms:identifier \""ENSG00000012048\"" ;\n        obo:RO_0002162 taxonomy:9606 .\n  ?transcript so:transcribed_from ?gene ;\n              dcterms:identifier ?transcript_id ;\n              so:translates_to ?protein .\n  ?protein dcterms:identifier ?protein_id ;\n           rdfs:seeAlso ?uniprot .\n  FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?uniprot), \""http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/\""))\n}\nORDER BY ?transcript_id""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""ensembl"", ""sparql_query"": ""PREFIX terms: <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/terms/ensembl/>\nPREFIX so: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/so#>\nPREFIX obo: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/>\nPREFIX taxonomy: <http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uniprot\nFROM <http://rdfportal.org/dataset/ensembl>\nWHERE {\n  ?gene a terms:EnsemblGene ;\n        dcterms:identifier \""ENSG00000012048\"" ;\n        obo:RO_0002162 taxonomy:9606 .\n  ?transcript so:transcribed_from ?gene ;\n              so:translates_to ?protein .\n  ?protein rdfs:seeAlso ?uniprot .\n  FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?uniprot), \""http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/\""))\n}\nORDER BY ?uniprot""}}]",CRITICAL,"17 UniProt isoforms (P38398 canonical, plus H0Y850, E7EQW4, and others)",Database: Ensembl.
