## Genome Sequences Linked to BacDive Strains

Based on my query of the BacDive RDF database, here are the statistics for genome sequences:

**Overall Statistics:**
- **17,607 strains** have genome sequence data linked to them
- **50,588 total genome sequences** are available across all strains

**Breakdown by Sequence Database:**

1. **NCBI** - 21,630 genome sequences covering 16,652 strains
2. **PATRIC** - 17,185 genome sequences covering 11,916 strains  
3. **IMG** (Integrated Microbial Genomes) - 11,773 genome sequences covering 10,029 strains

**Key Insights:**
- Some strains have genome sequences available from multiple databases, which is why the total number of sequences (50,588) is higher than the number of unique strains (17,607)
- Out of BacDive's ~97,000 total strain records, approximately **18% have genome sequence data** linked to them
- NCBI is the most common source for genome sequences in BacDive

83,2026-01-22,Structured Query,How many MedGen concepts have MONDO cross-references?,True,False,True,1.0,"I don't have access to current statistics about the exact number of MedGen concepts that have MONDO (Monarch Disease Ontology) cross-references in my training data.

However, I can tell you that:

1. **MedGen** is NCBI's database that aggregates information about human medical genetics and conditions
2. **MONDO** is a disease ontology that aims to harmonize disease definitions across multiple sources
3. MedGen does incorporate cross-references to various disease ontologies and classification systems, including MONDO

To get the current, accurate number of MedGen concepts with MONDO cross-references, you would need to:
- Query the MedGen database directly
- Check the latest MedGen release notes or statistics pages
- Download the MedGen data files (like the MGCONSO.RRF file) and count entries with MONDO source identifiers

The number would also change over time as both databases are actively maintained and updated.",,6.869831085205078,50,213,True,True,1.0,"Perfect! Based on the SPARQL query results, **22,846 MedGen concepts have MONDO cross-references**.

To provide additional context:
- MedGen contains 233,939 total concepts
- This means approximately **9.8%** of MedGen concepts have MONDO cross-references
- According to the MIE documentation, MONDO has about 70% coverage in MedGen overall, which likely means that 70% of disease-related concepts (not all concept types) have MONDO mappings
