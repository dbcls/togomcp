108,2026-01-22,Structured Query,How many species have taxonomy entries at the species rank in NCBI Taxonomy?,True,False,True,1.0,"I don't have access to real-time data from the NCBI Taxonomy database, so I cannot provide the current exact number of species-rank entries.

However, I can tell you that:

1. **The number is very large and constantly growing** - NCBI Taxonomy contains millions of taxonomic entries across all ranks, with species-level entries making up a substantial portion.

2. **As of recent years**, the database has contained well over 1 million species-rank entries, and this number increases regularly as new species are sequenced and added.

3. **The growth is ongoing** because:
   - New species are continuously being discovered and sequenced
   - Metagenomic studies add uncultured species
   - Historical sequences are being annotated and added

To get the current exact number, you would need to:
- Query the NCBI Taxonomy database directly
- Check NCBI Taxonomy statistics pages
- Use their API or download their taxonomy dump files

The number changes frequently enough that any specific figure I might recall from training data would likely be outdated.",,6.490192890167236,54,238,True,True,1.0,"According to the NCBI Taxonomy database, there are **2,232,851 species** entries at the species rank.
