14,2026-01-31,Structured Query,What are the most potent inhibitors of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)?,True,True,False,0.375,"The most potent inhibitors of human EGFR fall into several categories:

## **Small Molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)**

### First-generation (reversible):
- **Gefitinib** (Iressa) - IC50 ~1-20 nM
- **Erlotinib** (Tarceva) - IC50 ~2 nM
- These are selective for EGFR but reversibly bind

### Second-generation (irreversible):
- **Afatinib** (Gilotrif) - IC50 ~0.5 nM - covalently binds to EGFR
- **Dacomitinib** - IC50 ~0.6 nM
- These are pan-HER inhibitors (target EGFR, HER2, HER4)

### Third-generation (irreversible, mutant-selective):
- **Osimertinib** (Tagrisso) - IC50 ~12-15 nM for mutant EGFR, >200 nM for wild-type
- Designed to overcome T790M resistance mutation while sparing wild-type EGFR

## **Monoclonal Antibodies**

- **Cetuximab** (Erbitux) - Kd ~0.2 nM
- **Panitumumab** (Vectibix) - Kd ~0.05 nM
- These bind the extracellular domain, preventing ligand binding

## **Potency Considerations**

The ""most potent"" depends on context:

## Answer

**CHEMBL941** (Imatinib) corresponds to **PubChem Compound ID: 5291**

### How They Are Linked

The connection between ChEMBL and PubChem databases is established through **cross-reference mappings** in the ChEMBL RDF database. Specifically:

1. **Direct Cross-Reference**: ChEMBL compounds link to PubChem using the property `cco:moleculeXref`, which points to the PubChem compound URI:
   - ChEMBL URI: `http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/resource/chembl/molecule/CHEMBL941`
   - PubChem URI: `http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5291`

2. **Relationship Type**: According to the TogoID database, the relationship between ChEMBL compounds and PubChem compounds is classified as ""**is nearly equivalent to**"" (bidirectional), meaning they represent the same chemical entity but may have slightly different representations or metadata in each database.

### Additional Cross-References

CHEMBL941 (Imatinib) is also linked to many other databases, including:
- **ChEBI**: CHEBI:45783 (via `skos:exactMatch`)
- **DrugBank**: DB00619
- **HMDB**: HMDB0014757
- **PDB**: Chemical component STI

19,2026-01-31,Specificity,What ClinVar variants have conflicting clinical interpretations from different laboratories?,True,False,False,0.2857142857142857,"I can provide information about ClinVar's conflicting interpretation classifications based on my training knowledge.

ClinVar tracks variants where different submitting laboratories have provided different clinical significance interpretations. These are typically flagged with specific categories:

## Common Conflicting Interpretation Patterns:

1. **""Conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity""** - This is the most common designation, where submitters disagree on classification (e.g., one lab calls it pathogenic while another calls it benign or VUS)

2. **Typical conflicts include:**
   - Pathogenic vs. Likely Pathogenic vs. VUS
   - Pathogenic vs. Benign
   - Benign vs. VUS
   - Likely Benign vs. VUS

## Examples of genes with historically high rates of conflicts:
- **BRCA1 and BRCA2** - breast/ovarian cancer genes
- **MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2** - Lynch syndrome genes
- **LDLR** - familial hypercholesterolemia
- **SCN5A** - cardiac arrhythmia gene
- **KCNQ1, KCNH2** - Long QT syndrome genes

## Why conflicts occur:
- Different evidence thresholds
- Access to different patient/family data
- Different computational predictions
- Evolving evidence over time
- Different interpretation of ACMG/AMP guidelines

**Note:** I cannot query the current ClinVar database to give you specific variant IDs or current statistics. For actual variant-level data with conflicts, you would need to search ClinVar directly at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ using filters for ""conflicting interpretations.""",,9.870668888092041,52,397,True,True,0.8571428571428571,"Excellent!

## ClinVar Variants with Conflicting Clinical Interpretations

I found **numerous variants** in ClinVar where different laboratories have submitted conflicting interpretations of their pathogenicity. Here are the most notable examples with the highest number of submitters:

### Top 5 Variants with Conflicting Interpretations:

1. **SPG7 c.1529C>T (p.Ala510Val)** - VCV000042016
   - **64 submitters** with conflicting classifications
   - Gene: SPG7 (chromosome 16)
   - Associated with: Hereditary spastic paraplegia type 7, ataxia
   - Allele frequency: ~0.36% in population databases

2. **APC c.3920T>A (p.Ile1307Lys)** - VCV000000822
   - **52 submitters** with conflicting classifications  
   - Gene: APC (chromosome 5)
   - Associated with: Colorectal cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis
   - Classification: ""Conflicting classifications of pathogenicity; association; risk factor""
   - Allele frequency: ~0.12% (more common in Ashkenazi Jewish populations)

3. **POLG c.1760C>T (p.Pro587Leu)** - VCV000013505
   - **52 submitters** with conflicting classifications
   - Gene: POLG (chromosome 15)
   - Associated with: Mitochondrial disorders, progressive external ophthalmoplegia
   - Allele frequency: ~0.15%

4. **POLG c.752C>T (p.Thr251Ile)** - VCV000013503
   - **51 submitters** with conflicting classifications
   - Gene: POLG (chromosome 15)
   - Associated with: POLG-related mitochondrial disorders

5. **HFE c.187C>G (p.His63Asp)** - VCV000000010
   - **51 submitters** with conflicting classifications
   - Gene: HFE (chromosome 6)
   - Associated with: Hereditary hemochromatosis (iron overload)
   - Classification: ""Conflicting classifications of pathogenicity; other""
   - Allele frequency: ~10% (very common variant)

### Additional Notable Examples:

- **BTD c.1270G>C** (50 submitters) - Biotinidase deficiency
- **CHEK2 c.1427C>T** (50 submitters) - Breast/ovarian cancer predisposition
- **SERPINA1 c.1096G>A** (45 submitters) - Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
- **TNFRSF13B c.310T>C** (45 submitters) - Immunodeficiency
- **CHEK2 c.470T>C** (43 submitters) - Cancer predisposition

### Why Do Conflicting Interpretations Occur?

Conflicts arise due to:
- **Different evidence levels** - Labs may have access to different functional studies or patient data
- **Population frequency considerations** - Some variants are common in certain populations but rare in others
- **Incomplete penetrance** - Not all carriers develop disease
- **Variant effect complexity** - Effects may depend on genetic background or be context-dependent
- **Evolving evidence** - As new data emerges, interpretations change but historical submissions remain

22,2026-01-31,Currency,Which Reactome pathways have been associated with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing mechanisms?,True,False,True,0.75,"I don't have specific information in my training data about Reactome pathways directly associated with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing mechanisms.

This is likely because:

1. **CRISPR-Cas9 is a bacterial adaptive immune system** - It originated in bacteria and archaea as a defense mechanism against viruses, not as an endogenous human/mammalian pathway.

2. **Reactome focuses on biological pathways** - Reactome is a curated database of biological pathways primarily in humans and model organisms. CRISPR-Cas9 itself is an engineered tool used for research and therapeutic applications rather than a natural biological pathway in these organisms.

3. **Related pathways might include**:
   - **DNA repair pathways** (like Non-Homologous End Joining - NHEJ, and Homology Directed Repair - HDR) that are activated after CRISPR-Cas9 creates double-strand breaks
   - **DNA damage response pathways**
   - Pathways involved in **genome stability**

If you're looking for pathways related to the cellular responses and mechanisms that occur *after* CRISPR-Cas9 introduces DNA breaks, those DNA repair and damage response pathways in Reactome would be most relevant. However, I cannot provide specific Reactome pathway identifiers or detailed associations with certainty from my training knowledge alone.

Would you like me to discuss the DNA repair mechanisms that are commonly exploited in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing applications?",,8.22296404838562,60,346,True,True,0.625,"Based on my search of the Reactome database, **CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing mechanisms are not currently represented as specific pathways in Reactome**. The searches for ""CRISPR,"" ""Cas9,"" and ""CRISPR-Cas9"" did not return any dedicated CRISPR-related pathways.

However, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing relies on cellular DNA repair mechanisms that **are** well-documented in Reactome. The most relevant pathways would be:

## Related DNA Repair Pathways:

1. **DNA Double-Strand Break Repair (R-HSA-5693532)** - This is the primary pathway relevant to CRISPR-Cas9, as Cas9 creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA

2. **DNA Double Strand Break Response (R-HSA-5693606)** - The cellular response to DSBs, which is triggered by CRISPR-Cas9 cutting activity

These pathways are available across multiple species in Reactome (human, mouse, rat, dog, cow, pig, zebrafish, chicken, and others).

## Why This Matters:

When CRISPR-Cas9 cuts DNA at a target site, cells repair the break using one of two main mechanisms:
- **Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)** - error-prone repair
- **Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)** - precise repair using a template

Both of these repair mechanisms are part of the DNA Double-Strand Break Repair pathway in Reactome.

So while CRISPR-Cas9 itself isn't catalogued as a Reactome pathway (as it's a research tool rather than an endogenous biological process), the cellular machinery it exploits is well-documented in the DNA repair pathways.",,30.277487754821777,16,800,10178,86321,"mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing"", ""rows"": 30}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""CRISPR Cas9"", ""rows"": 30}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""Cas9"", ""rows"": 30}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity"", ""input"": {""query"": ""DNA repair double strand break"", ""rows"": 30, ""types"": [""Pathway""]}}]",CRITICAL,"Pathways related to DNA repair, homologous recombination, and genome editing processes","SIMPLE QUERY - Straightforward pathway search.
