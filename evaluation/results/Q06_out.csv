- **Glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.2)** has a higher Km for glucose and is primarily found in liver and pancreatic beta cells, serving as a glucose sensor",,27.47574496269226,21,881,1960,107290,"mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql","[{""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""rhea"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX rh: <http://rdf.rhea-db.org/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT ?ecNumber ?ecLabel\nWHERE {\n  <http://rdf.rhea-db.org/17825> rh:ec ?ec .\n  ?ec rdfs:label ?ecLabel .\n  BIND(STRAFTER(STR(?ec), \""http://purl.uniprot.org/enzyme/\"") AS ?ecNumber)\n}\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""rhea"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX rh: <http://rdf.rhea-db.org/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT ?p ?o\nWHERE {\n  <http://rdf.rhea-db.org/17825> ?p ?o .\n}\nLIMIT 100\n""}}, {""name"": ""mcp__togomcp__run_sparql"", ""input"": {""dbname"": ""rhea"", ""sparql_query"": ""\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT ?ec ?ecLabel\nWHERE {\n  VALUES ?ec { \n    <http://purl.uniprot.org/enzyme/2.7.1.1>\n    <http://purl.uniprot.org/enzyme/2.7.1.2>\n  }\n  ?ec rdfs:label ?ecLabel .\n}\n""}}]",CRITICAL,EC 2.7.1.1 (hexokinase) and EC 2.7.1.2 (glucokinase),Database: Rhea.

However, I can tell you that:

1. **The vast majority of PDB structures have UniProt cross-references** - typically well over 100,000 structures, as most protein structures in the PDB can be mapped to UniProt entries.

2. **The exact number changes regularly** as:
   - New structures are deposited to the PDB (thousands per year)
   - Cross-reference mappings are updated and improved
   - Both databases continue to grow

3. **Not all PDB entries have UniProt cross-references** because:
   - Some structures contain only DNA/RNA
   - Some contain synthetic or modified proteins not in UniProt
   - Some structures are of proteins from organisms not yet well-characterized in UniProt
