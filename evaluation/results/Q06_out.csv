- **BRCA1 c.181T>G** - founder mutation in some populations

### Clinical Significance:

Pathogenic BRCA1 variants are inherited in an **autosomal dominant** pattern, meaning each child of a carrier has a 50% chance of inheriting the variant.

Would you like more specific information about any particular variant or associated condition?",,9.444184064865112,53,410,True,True,0.6153846153846154,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about BRCA1 pathogenic variants. Let me compile this information into a clear summary for the user.

## Pathogenic Variants in BRCA1 and Associated Disease Conditions

I've found extensive information about pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 gene (NCBI Gene ID: 672) from the ClinVar database. Here's a comprehensive summary:

### **BRCA1 Gene Overview**
- **UniProt ID**: P38398
- **Full Name**: Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein
- **Function**: RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase (EC 2.3.2.27)
- **Location**: Chromosome 17q21.31

### **Primary Associated Disease Conditions**

The pathogenic BRCA1 variants are primarily associated with:

1. **Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC)**
   - Most common association
   - Also called: Familial breast-ovarian cancer syndrome
   - OMIM ID: 604370

2. **Breast-Ovarian Cancer, Familial, Susceptibility to, 1**

#### **5. Missense Variants**
- **c.181T>C (p.Cys61Arg)** - Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic
- **c.182G>A (p.Cys61Tyr)** - Pathogenic

### **Clinical Significance Classifications**

The variants are classified as:
- **Pathogenic**: Clear evidence of disease-causing potential
- **Likely Pathogenic**: Strong evidence but not conclusive
- **Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic**: Multiple submissions with slight variation
- **Conflicting Classifications**: Some variants have conflicting evidence

### **Key Clinical Implications**

1. **Cancer Risk**: Women with pathogenic BRCA1 variants have significantly elevated lifetime risks:
   - Breast cancer: 55-72%

However, I can share some general information about the types of variants typically found in BRCA1:

## Common BRCA1 Variant Types:

1. **Missense variants** - Single nucleotide changes resulting in amino acid substitutions
2. **Frameshift variants** - Insertions or deletions causing reading frame shifts
3. **Nonsense variants** - Changes creating premature stop codons
4. **Splice site variants** - Affecting RNA splicing
5. **Large deletions/duplications** - Structural variants affecting one or more exons
6. **Intronic variants** - Within introns, some affecting splicing
7. **Synonymous variants** - Not changing amino acids (often benign)

## Clinical Significance Distribution:

Historically, BRCA1 variants in ClinVar have included:
- Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic variants
- Benign/Likely benign variants
- Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)

To get the current distribution of BRCA1 variant types in ClinVar, you would need to:
- Query the ClinVar database directly at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar
- Download the latest ClinVar data files
- Use the ClinVar API for programmatic access

## Distribution of BRCA1 Variant Types in ClinVar

Based on the current ClinVar database, there are **14,835 BRCA1 variants** with the following distribution by variant type:

### Variant Type Distribution

| Variant Type | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Single nucleotide variant** | 11,150 | 75.2% |
| **Deletion** | 2,108 | 14.2% |
| **Duplication** | 712 | 4.8% |
| **Insertion** | 373 | 2.5% |
| **Indel** | 261 | 1.8% |
| **Microsatellite** | 194 | 1.3% |
| **Protein only** | 30 | 0.2% |
| **Inversion** | 4 | <0.1% |
| **Haplotype** | 3 | <0.1% |

### Key Findings:

1. **Single nucleotide variants (SNVs)** are by far the most common type, accounting for **over 75%** of all BRCA1 variants in ClinVar.

2. **Structural variants** (Deletions, Duplications, Insertions, Indels) collectively represent about **23%** of BRCA1 variants, with deletions being the most common structural variant type.

3. **Rare variant types** like inversions and haplotypes represent less than 0.1% of all variants.

### Clinical Significance Distribution:

Among BRCA1 variants with clinical significance annotations:
- **Pathogenic**: 3,638 variants (27.4%)
- **Conflicting classifications**: 2,875 variants (21.7%)
- **Likely benign**: 2,663 variants (20.1%)
- **Uncertain significance**: 2,243 variants (16.9%)
- **Not provided**: 2,155 variants (16.2%)
- **Benign**: 727 variants (5.5%)

67,2026-01-31,Specificity,Which GO molecular functions have enzyme classification (EC) numbers?,True,True,True,0.7777777777777778,"Based on my training knowledge, many GO molecular function terms are associated with enzyme classification (EC) numbers. Here are the main categories:

## Major GO Molecular Functions with EC Numbers:

1. **Oxidoreductases (EC 1.-)** - catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions
   - Examples: dehydrogenases, oxidases, peroxidases, reductases

2. **Transferases (EC 2.-)** - transfer functional groups between molecules
   - Examples: kinases, methyltransferases, glycosyltransferases, aminotransferases

3. **Hydrolases (EC 3.-)** - catalyze hydrolysis reactions
   - Examples: proteases, lipases, phosphatases, nucleases, esterases

4. **Lyases (EC 4.-)** - cleave bonds by means other than hydrolysis
   - Examples: decarboxylases, aldolases, dehydratases

5. **Isomerases (EC 5.-)** - catalyze isomerization reactions
   - Examples: racemases, epimerases, mutases

6. **Ligases (EC 6.-)** - catalyze bond formation coupled with ATP hydrolysis
   - Examples: synthetases, carboxylases, DNA ligase, aminoacyl-tRNA ligases

7. **Translocases (EC 7.-)** - catalyze movement of ions or molecules across membranes
   - Examples: various transporters and channels with catalytic activity

## Key Points:
- GO molecular function terms for catalytic activities are often cross-referenced with their corresponding EC numbers
- The EC number provides a systematic classification of the enzyme's catalytic mechanism
- Not all GO molecular functions have EC numbers - only those describing catalytic/enzymatic activities",,8.515615940093994,49,417,True,True,0.5555555555555556,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about GO molecular functions with EC numbers. Let me provide a clear summary to the user.

This ultra-high resolution structure (PDB ID: 2FEJ) was reported and represents one of the highest resolution structures available for the p53 core domain. At this resolution, individual atoms can be visualized with exceptional clarity, including alternative conformations and detailed water networks.

For context, typical high-resolution protein structures range from 1.5-2.0 Å, so a 1.0 Å structure is exceptionally detailed and provides valuable insights into the atomic details of the DNA-binding domain, including the zinc-binding site and DNA-contact residues.",,5.1980249881744385,56,164,True,True,0.5,"Perfect!
