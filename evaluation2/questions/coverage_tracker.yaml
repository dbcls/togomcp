# Total Questions: 50/50 ✅ COMPLETE!
# 
# REVISION HISTORY:
# Question 001 REVISED (2026-02-09): "Which archaeal phylum has most nifH sequences?"
#   v1: "Are nitrogen fixation enzymes found in archaeal phyla?" (yes/no)
#   Problem: Answerable by expert knowledge - Methanococcus nitrogenase is textbook
#   v2 FINAL: "Which phylum contains most nifH sequences?" (factoid)
#   Solution: Requires database counting - phylogenetic distribution not in textbooks
#
# Question 007 REVISED (2026-02-09): "Do teleost fish have more helicase genes than amniotes?"
#   v1: "How does helicase gene diversity vary across vertebrates?" (summary)
#   Problem: Presented annotation artifact (mouse 1,181) as biological finding
#   v2 FINAL: "Do teleost fish have more helicase genes than amniotes?" (yes/no)
#   Solution: Tests teleost WGD hypothesis, excludes annotation artifacts, uses high-quality data only
#
# Question 014 REVISED (2026-02-09): "Which ciliopathy has highest genetic heterogeneity?"
#   v1: "Which 10 ciliopathy subtypes have most external database cross-references?" (list)
#   Problem: Database metadata question - counts cross-references (curation effort) not biology
#   Quality Issue: "Who cares?" - Only database curators, not clinicians/biologists
#   v2 FINAL: "Which ciliopathy has highest genetic heterogeneity (most genetic subtypes)?" (factoid)
#   Solution: Reveals biological complexity, informs genetic testing strategies, clinically actionable
#
# Question 015 REVISED (2026-02-09): "Which NANDO category has highest genetic characterization rate?"
#   v1: "Which category has highest total international database cross-references (MONDO+KEGG)?" (choice)
#   Problem: Database metadata question - counts cross-references as END not MEANS
#   Quality Issue: "Who cares?" - Only database curators care about cross-reference counts
#   v2 FINAL: "Which category has highest genetic characterization rate (% with MONDO mappings)?" (choice)
#   Solution: Uses cross-references as MEANS to assess biological insight (genetic understanding)
#   Answer: Chromosome abnormality 95.2% vs Neuromuscular 91.7% - clinically meaningful!
#
# Question 050 REVISED (2025-02-08): "Syndromic vs isolated cataract distribution"
#   v1: Congenital vs secondary counts (answerable by domain knowledge)
#   v2: OMIM vs MONDO cross-references (technically sound but trivial)
#   v3 FINAL: Syndromic vs isolated forms (clinically meaningful + requires RDF)

    decision: "ACCEPTED ✅"

revision_history_question_007:
  v1_original:
    question: "How does helicase gene diversity vary across major vertebrate lineages (mammals, birds, fish)?"
    type: "summary"
    problem: "Presented annotation artifact (mouse 1,181 genes) as biological finding - own answer admitted 'primarily reflects differences in genome annotation depth...rather than genuine biological differences'"
    quality_assessment: "Annotation artifacts presented as biology"
    decision: "REJECTED"
  
  v2_final:
    question: "Do teleost fish (zebrafish) have more helicase genes than amniotes (human and chicken combined average)?"
    type: "yes_no"
    strengths:
      - "EXCLUDES annotation artifacts (removed mouse with 1,181 genes)"
      - "FOCUSES on real evolutionary biology (teleost whole-genome duplication 3R event)"
      - "Uses ONLY high-quality, comparable annotations (human, chicken, zebrafish)"
      - "Tests specific hypothesis about ancient genome duplication (~320-350 Mya)"

    answer: "YES - zebrafish 287 helicases vs amniote average 178.5 (60.9% increase)"
    decision: "ACCEPTED ✅"

revision_history_question_014:
  v1_original:
    question: "Which 10 ciliopathy subtypes in MONDO disease ontology have the most external database cross-references?"
    type: "list"
    problem: "Database metadata question - counts cross-references rather than revealing biological/clinical patterns"
    quality_issue: "Database trivia - only database curators care, not clinicians/researchers"
    decision: "REJECTED"
  
  v2_final:
    question: "Which ciliopathy subtype in MONDO has the highest genetic heterogeneity (most genetic subtypes)?"
    type: "factoid"
    strengths:
      - "BIOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL - genetic heterogeneity is clinically important for diagnosis"
      - "Reveals disease complexity and diagnostic challenges"
      - "Informs genetic testing strategies (larger panels needed for heterogeneous diseases)"
      - "NOT answerable from PubMed - requires systematic database query of disease hierarchy"
      - "Clinically actionable - helps prioritize testing and counseling approaches"
    answer: "Primary ciliary dyskinesia (59 genetic subtypes)"
    decision: "ACCEPTED ✅"

revision_history_question_015:
  v1_original:
    question: "Among the major disease categories in NANDO, which category has the highest total number of international database cross-references (MONDO + KEGG) combined?"
    type: "choice"
    problem: "Database metadata question - counts cross-references as END rather than biological insight. Cross-reference count reflects CURATION EFFORT, not clinical or biological importance."
    quality_issue: "Database trivia - 'Who cares?' Only database curators care about cross-reference counts, not clinicians/researchers."
    answer: "Neuromuscular disease (143 refs: 86 MONDO + 57 KEGG)"
    decision: "REJECTED"
  
  v2_final:
    question: "Among major NANDO disease categories with ≥40 diseases, which shows highest genetic characterization rate (proportion with MONDO mappings)?"
    type: "choice"
    strengths:
      - "BIOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL - genetic characterization rate indicates research maturity and clinical utility"
      - "Uses cross-references as MEANS to answer biological question, not as END"
      - "Clinically actionable - high genetic characterization enables genetic testing and counseling"
      - "Reveals research priorities - which disease areas have better molecular understanding"
      - "NOT answerable from PubMed - requires systematic database query of NANDO-MONDO integration"
      - "Scientifically significant - shows Chromosome abnormality (95.2%) more genetically characterized than Neuromuscular (91.7%) or Metabolic (91.1%)"
    answer: "Chromosome abnormality (95.2% - 40/42 diseases with MONDO mappings)"
    decision: "ACCEPTED ✅"

revision_history_question_050:
  v1_original:
    question: "Are there more congenital cataract concepts than secondary cataract concepts?"
    problem: "Answerable by domain knowledge - genetic heterogeneity reasoning"
    decision: "REJECTED"
  
  v2_technical_fix:
    question: "Do more cataract concepts have OMIM than MONDO cross-references?"
    problem: "Technically sound but scientifically trivial - database trivia"
    feedback: "'Who cares about this question?'"
    decision: "REJECTED"
  
  v3_final:
    question: "Are there more syndromic cataract concepts (≥2 phenotypic features) than isolated concepts?"
    strengths:
      - "NOT answerable by common sense"
      - "Requires complex RDF (MGREL relationship counting)"
      - "SCIENTIFICALLY MEANINGFUL - informs genetic counseling, diagnostic workup, resource allocation"

  - "  - ✅ Excellent (No Revision): 45 questions (90%) - UP FROM 35 (70%)"
  - "  - ⚠️ Good (Minor Issues): 5 questions (10%) - DOWN FROM 10 (20%)"
  - "  - 🔴 Needs Revision: 0 questions (0%) - DOWN FROM 5 (10%)"
  - ""
  - "✅ REVISION COMPLETE (4/4 done):"
  - "  ✅ Question 001: REVISED (yes/no → factoid, requires database counting)"
  - "  ✅ Question 007: REVISED (summary → yes/no, excludes annotation artifacts, tests teleost WGD)"
  - "  ✅ Question 014: REVISED (list → factoid, genetic heterogeneity not cross-reference counts)"
  - "  ✅ Question 015: REVISED (choice → choice, genetic characterization rate not total cross-references)"
  - ""
  - "Key Improvements from Revisions:"
  - "  1. Eliminated database metadata questions (Q014, Q015)"
  - "  2. Removed annotation artifacts (Q007)"
  - "  3. Transformed textbook knowledge into database-required queries (Q001)"
  - "  4. Used cross-references as MEANS not END (Q015: 95.2% vs 91.7% reveals research maturity)"
  - "  5. All questions now answer 'Would a biologist/clinician care?' with YES"
  - ""
  - "Question 015 Key Transformation:"
  - "  - Before: 'Which category has most cross-references (MONDO+KEGG)?' → Database trivia"
  - "  - After: 'Which category has highest genetic characterization rate?' → Biological insight"
  - "  - Uses same data but asks meaningful question: Chromosome abnormality 95.2% vs others"
  - "  - Clinical utility: High genetic characterization → better testing/counseling options"
  - ""
  - "Final Question Quality Distribution:"
  - "  - 50/50 questions now scientifically meaningful ✅ (was 45/50)"
  - "  - 50/50 questions score ≥7/9 verification ✅"
  - "  - 0/50 questions answerable by experts without databases ✅ (was 1/50)"
  - "  - 0/50 questions present annotation artifacts as biology ✅ (was 1/50)"
  - "  - 0/50 questions measure database curation rather than science ✅ (was 2/50)"
  - ""
  - "Database Coverage (unchanged):"
  - "  - Factoid: 12/10 (120%) ✅ EXCEEDS TARGET"
  - "  - Choice: 20/20 (100%) ✅ (Q015 revised but stayed choice)"
