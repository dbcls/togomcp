    type: factoid
    databases: ["Rhea", "UniProt", "PDB"]
    keyword: "KW-0350: Heme biosynthesis"
    score: 12
    notes: "Excellent biological insight (structural gap in rate-limiting enzyme), 3-database integration via Search API discovery + SPARQL validation, single definitive answer (ALAS1). Used priority database (Rhea). Demonstrates isoform-specific structural characterization disparity with medical relevance (porphyria vs sideroblastic anemia)."

    type: list
    databases: ["PubMed", "UniProt", "PDB", "ChEMBL"]
    keyword: "KW-0043: Tumor suppressor"
    score: 12
    notes: "Strong biological insight (therapeutic translation of structural biology), 4-database integration, bounded list (5 items). Used priority database (PubMed) as anchor. Demonstrates literature→protein→structure→drugs integration pattern. Reveals which tumor suppressors have progressed from structural characterization to clinical development. Training knowledge test explicitly documented."

  - id: question_004
    type: yes_no
    databases: ["UniProt", "Taxonomy"]
    keyword: "KW-0684: Rhamnose metabolism"
    score: 11
    notes: "Strong biological insight (phylogenetic restriction of rhamnose metabolism), 2-database integration (UniProt → Taxonomy), definitive yes/no answer (NO - only Pseudomonadota and Actinomycetota). Used priority database (Taxonomy). Random keyword selection (KW-0684 selected via random number generator). Demonstrates enzyme-to-phylum classification pattern. Training knowledge test documented. Answer reveals evolutionary conservation of rhamnose-based glycosylation."

  - id: question_005
    type: factoid
    databases: ["Glycosmos", "UniProt", "Taxonomy"]
    keyword: "KW-0723: Serine/threonine-protein kinase"
    score: 11
    notes: "Strong biological insight (WNK1 extensive glycosylation relevant to ion homeostasis regulation and Gordon's syndrome), 3-database integration, single definitive answer (WNK1 with 76 sites). Used priority database (Glycosmos 0/3 → 1/3). Random keyword selection (KW-0723 #723 from 1281 unused). Demonstrates glycoprotein→kinase→taxonomy filter integration pattern. Training knowledge test explicitly documented. Reveals exceptional post-translational modification of a master ion homeostasis regulator."

  - id: question_006
    type: factoid
    databases: ["UniProt", "PDB"]
    keyword: "KW-0500: Molybdenum"
    score: 11
    notes: "Strong biological insight (nitrogenase's 62 structures reflect nitrogen fixation importance), 2-database integration (UniProt keyword search → PDB cross-reference aggregation), single definitive answer (nitrogenase with 62 structures). Random keyword selection (KW-0500 selected randomly). Demonstrates protein→structure integration via rdfs:seeAlso. Training knowledge test explicitly documented. Reveals which Mo-enzyme mechanism is most structurally characterized, indicating research priorities in nitrogen cycling."

  - id: question_007
    type: factoid
    databases: ["ChEBI", "Reactome"]
    keyword: "KW-0784: Thiamine biosynthesis"
    score: 12
    notes: "Excellent biological insight (free thiamine > TPP reveals transport/biosynthesis pathway coverage), 2-database integration (ChEBI chemical ontology → Reactome pathway usage), single definitive answer (thiamine/THMN 60 pathways). Used TWO priority databases (ChEBI 0/3 → 1/3, Reactome 0/3 → 1/3). Random keyword selection (KW-0784 position 202 from 1275 unused). Demonstrates chemical→pathway integration via bp:xref. Training knowledge test explicitly documented. Counter-intuitive finding: free form (60) > active cofactor TPP (52) > ThTP (28), revealing database emphasis on cofactor logistics over just enzymatic chemistry."

  - id: question_008
    type: list
    databases: ["UniProt", "Taxonomy"]
    keyword: "KW-1203: Blood coagulation cascade inhibiting toxin"
    score: 11
    notes: "Strong biological insight (Daboia dominance reflects medical importance of Russell's viper), 2-database integration (UniProt anticoagulant toxins → PDB structures → Taxonomy genus), bounded list (5 genera with structure counts). Random keyword selection (KW-1203 position 1196 from 1278 unused). Demonstrates toxin→structure→taxonomy integration pattern. Training knowledge test explicitly documented. Reveals research priorities in venom structural biology: Daboia (69) >> Bothrops (12) > Protobothrops (11) > Gloydius (6) > Bungarus (5), indicating Asian pit viper focus."
