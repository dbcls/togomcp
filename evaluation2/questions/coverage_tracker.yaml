# Updated: 2026-02-11 (QUESTION 003 REPLACEMENT)
# Total Questions: 50/50 ✅ COMPLETE!
# 
# REVISION HISTORY:
# Question 001 REPLACED (2026-02-11): "Glycosylation landscape of growth factor receptors"
#   v1 (2025-02-08): "Are nitrogen fixation enzymes found in archaeal phyla?" (yes/no)
#   Problem: Answerable by expert knowledge - Methanococcus nitrogenase is textbook
#   v2 (2026-02-09): "Which phylum contains most nifH sequences?" (factoid)
#   Problem: Needed to diversify question types and database usage
#   v3 FINAL (2026-02-11): "Glycosylation landscape of growth factor receptors" (summary)
#   Solution: Summary type using underutilized Glycosmos, showcases glycosylation site analysis
#
# Question 003 REPLACED (2026-02-11): "Top 5 hyperthermophilic genera by max growth temperature"
#   v1 (original): "Which human glycoprotein has most glycosylation sites?" (factoid)
#   Problem: DUPLICATE of Question 037 - both ask same question about Megalin/P98164 with 1,153 sites!
#   v2 FINAL: "List top 5 bacterial genera with growth ≥70°C by max temperature" (list)
#   Solution: List type (60%→70%), eliminates duplicate, showcases BacDive extremophile data
#
# Question 007 REVISED (2026-02-09): "Do teleost fish have more helicase genes than amniotes?"
#   v1: "How does helicase gene diversity vary across vertebrates?" (summary)
#   Problem: Presented annotation artifact (mouse 1,181) as biological finding
#   v2 FINAL: "Do teleost fish have more helicase genes than amniotes?" (yes/no)
#   Solution: Tests teleost WGD hypothesis, excludes annotation artifacts, uses high-quality data only
#
# Question 014 REVISED (2026-02-09): "Which ciliopathy has highest genetic heterogeneity?"
#   v1: "Which 10 ciliopathy subtypes have most external database cross-references?" (list)
#   Problem: Database metadata question - counts cross-references (curation effort) not biology
#   Quality Issue: "Who cares?" - Only database curators, not clinicians/biologists
#   v2 FINAL: "Which ciliopathy has highest genetic heterogeneity (most genetic subtypes)?" (factoid)
#   Solution: Reveals biological complexity, informs genetic testing strategies, clinically actionable
#
# Question 015 REVISED (2026-02-09): "Which NANDO category has highest genetic characterization rate?"
#   v1: "Which category has highest total international database cross-references (MONDO+KEGG)?" (choice)
#   Problem: Database metadata question - counts cross-references as END not MEANS
#   Quality Issue: "Who cares?" - Only database curators care about cross-reference counts
#   v2 FINAL: "Which category has highest genetic characterization rate (% with MONDO mappings)?" (choice)
#   Solution: Uses cross-references as MEANS to assess biological insight (genetic understanding)
#   Answer: Chromosome abnormality 95.2% vs Neuromuscular 91.7% - clinically meaningful!
#
# Question 050 REVISED (2025-02-08): "Syndromic vs isolated cataract distribution"
#   v1: Congenital vs secondary counts (answerable by domain knowledge)
#   v2: OMIM vs MONDO cross-references (technically sound but trivial)
#   v3 FINAL: Syndromic vs isolated forms (clinically meaningful + requires RDF)
