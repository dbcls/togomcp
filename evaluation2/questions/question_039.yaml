question:
  body: |
    Among genetic syndromes associated with hearing loss, which syndrome has the most genetic loci (distinct OMIM entries) cataloged in MedGen, reflecting its extensive genetic heterogeneity?
  
  choices:
    A: "Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome"
    B: "Alport syndrome"
    C: "Waardenburg syndrome"
    D: "Usher syndrome"
  
  correct_answer: "D"
  
  explanation: |
    Usher syndrome has the most genetic loci with 33 distinct OMIM entries cataloged in MedGen, demonstrating exceptional genetic heterogeneity. The breakdown is:
    - Usher syndrome: 33 OMIM entries (subtypes 1A-1K, 2A-2D, 3A-3B, plus modifier loci)
    - Waardenburg syndrome: 16 OMIM entries (types 1-4 with various subtypes)
    - Alport syndrome: 9 OMIM entries (X-linked, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive forms)
    - Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome: 4 OMIM entries
    
    This extensive genetic heterogeneity reflects Usher syndrome's classification into three clinical types (USH1, USH2, USH3) and multiple subtypes, each caused by mutations in different genes encoding proteins involved in inner ear and retinal photoreceptor function.

    rationale: "Document the diversity of Usher syndrome subtypes"
    result: "Subtypes 1A-1K (11 subtypes), 2A-2D (4 subtypes), 3A-3B (2 subtypes), plus modifier loci"

  conclusion: "Usher syndrome has 33 distinct OMIM entries in MedGen, the most among hearing loss syndromes, reflecting its exceptional genetic heterogeneity"

notes:
  design_rationale: |
    This question showcases MedGen's unique capability to aggregate genetic locus information from OMIM across disease subtypes. Unlike individual OMIM entries or literature searches, MedGen provides a comprehensive view of genetic heterogeneity by linking syndrome concepts to all their associated OMIM phenotype and gene entries.
  
  database_usage:
    medgen_role: "PRIMARY - aggregates OMIM cross-references for comprehensive genetic heterogeneity assessment"
    pubmed_role: "Verification that literature doesn't provide this comparative data"
  
  why_not_uniprot: "This is a clinical genetics question about disease classification, not protein structure/function"
  
  genetic_background: |
    Usher syndrome's 33 OMIM entries reflect:
    - Type 1 (USH1): Severe hearing loss + prepubertal vision loss (11 subtypes: USH1A-K)
    - Type 2 (USH2): Moderate hearing loss + postpubertal vision loss (4 subtypes: USH2A-D)
    - Type 3 (USH3): Progressive hearing loss + variable vision loss (2 subtypes: USH3A-B)
    - Modifier loci affecting phenotype severity
    
    Each subtype involves different genes encoding proteins for inner ear hair cell stereocilia and retinal photoreceptor function.
  
  mie_compliance: |
    Followed MIE file guidance:
    1. Used kw_search_tools: [ncbi_esearch] for initial concept discovery
    2. Queried mo:mgconso blank nodes for OMIM cross-references
    3. Used FILTER(STRSTARTS()) for OMIM identifier pattern matching
    4. Counted DISTINCT to avoid duplicate cross-references
  
  validation:
    query_date: "2025-02-08"
    data_version: "MedGen February 2025 release"
    result_stability: "OMIM counts may increase with new genetic discoveries"
