# Question 045: ClinVar as PRIMARY - Congenital disorder of glycosylation gene variant frequency
# Type: FACTOID
# Database: ClinVar (single database)
# Keyword: KW-0900 (Congenital disorder of glycosylation)
# Created: 2025-02-08

question_id: "question_045"
question_type: "factoid"
keywords:
  - keyword_id: "KW-0900"
    name: "Congenital disorder of glycosylation"
    category: "Disease"

question_text: "Which gene has the most pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation in ClinVar?"

databases_used:
  primary:
    - name: "ClinVar"
      role: "PRIMARY - genetic variant frequency data"
      justification: "ClinVar contains clinical variant classifications and gene associations. This question requires counting pathogenic variants per gene, which is unique to ClinVar's structured data."

integration_level: "single_database"

correct_answer:
  answer_text: "PMM2"
  explanation: "PMM2 (phosphomannomutase 2) has 201 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for congenital disorders of glycosylation in ClinVar, significantly more than other CDG-associated genes (MPI: 138, ALG6: 136, DPAGT1: 38)."
  evidence_type: "comparative_count"

verification:
  verifiability: 3
  reasoning: "The answer is objectively verifiable by counting ClinVar variants. Results are deterministic and reproducible."
  
  rdf_necessity: 3
  reasoning: "Requires structured clinical variant database. PubMed articles discuss CDG clinically but don't provide ClinVar-specific variant counts needed for precise gene-by-gene comparison."
  
  scope: 3
  reasoning: "Question is bounded (pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants for CDG), specific (gene-level comparison), and has clear constraints (current ClinVar records)."

    - "congenital disorder of glycosylation PMM2 pathogenic variants count ClinVar"

    - "congenital disorder glycosylation most common gene"
  
  result: "not_answerable"
  explanation: |
    PubMed searches found general CDG literature and clinical descriptions. Some articles mention PMM2-CDG (CDG-Ia) is the most common type clinically, but none provide the specific ClinVar pathogenic variant counts needed to answer this question precisely. The question requires ClinVar's structured variant classification data to count pathogenic variants per gene accurately.

  why_rdf_needed: |
    This question showcases ClinVar's core capability: structured clinical variant classification. While PubMed articles discuss CDG epidemiology and mention PMM2-CDG is common, they don't provide the gene-by-gene variant count comparison from ClinVar that enables precise comparison. The question requires:
    1. Accessing ClinVar's 3.5M+ variant records
    2. Filtering by clinical significance (pathogenic/likely pathogenic)
    3. Linking variants to genes via blank node relationships
    4. Aggregating counts per gene for comparison
  
  biological_context: |
    Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a family of genetic disorders affecting protein and lipid glycosylation. PMM2-CDG (CDG-Ia) is the most common type, caused by mutations in phosphomannomutase 2. The high number of pathogenic variants in PMM2 reflects both its clinical prevalence and extensive clinical genetic testing. Other common CDG genes include ALG6 (CDG-Ic), MPI (CDG-Ib), and DPAGT1 (CDG-Ij). Each gene affects different steps in the glycosylation pathway.
