training_knowledge_test:
  attempted_answer: "From my training knowledge, I know nickel is a cofactor in several enzyme classes (urease, [NiFe]-hydrogenases, methyl-CoM reductase, Ni-SOD). The main nickel forms I know are Ni²⁺ ion and coenzyme F430 in methanogens. I'm aware that F430 biosynthesis involves several intermediates (like Ni-sirohydrochlorin), but I don't know the exact number of distinct nickel species cataloged in Rhea's current database. There could be transport-related species, biosynthetic intermediates, or other nickel complexes I'm not aware of."
  confidence_level: "low"
  knowledge_sources: "General knowledge of nickel biochemistry and major nickel-dependent enzymes from textbooks. No specific knowledge of Rhea database content or comprehensive enumeration of nickel species."
  requires_database: true
  reason: "This question requires systematic enumeration of ALL nickel-containing species in Rhea's current database. While I know major nickel cofactors, I cannot reliably count distinct species without querying the database. The answer depends on: (1) Rhea's current coverage of nickel biochemistry, (2) which biosynthetic intermediates are included, (3) which nickel complexes are cataloged. PubChem integration validates chemical structures via ChEBI cross-references."
  decision: "PASS - proceeded to discovery"

  total: 12
  passed: true
  rationale: |
    **Biological insight (3/3)**: Reveals the chemical diversity of nickel cofactors in biochemistry beyond the well-known Ni²⁺ and F430. Shows F430 biosynthetic pathway complexity with multiple intermediates (Ni-sirohydrochlorin, diamide form, seco-acid). Demonstrates nickel's role in specialized metabolic processes (methanogenesis, tetrapyrrole metabolism).
    
    **Multi-database integration (3/3)**: Exemplary 3-database integration via chemical identifiers:
    - Rhea: Comprehensive reaction search identifying 6 distinct species
    - ChEBI: Structural classification via rdfs:subClassOf links (all 6 species have ChEBI IDs)
    - PubChem: Chemical validation (F430 = CID 6449910, confirmed molecular formula C42H51N6NiO13+)
    Integration pattern: Rhea compound → ChEBI ID → PubChem CID for structural validation
    
    **Verifiability (3/3)**: Single numerical answer (6 species) with complete enumeration. Each species verified with ChEBI ID and biochemical role. No ambiguity - comprehensive SPARQL query ensures complete count.
    
    **RDF necessity (3/3)**: Impossible to answer from literature:
    - PubMed searches yield 0-1 articles, none enumerate Rhea's nickel species
    - Requires graph traversal: reaction → side → participant → compound → filter by nickel
    - Requires aggregation across all approved reactions
    - ChEBI cross-references enable PubChem integration for chemical validation

  conclusion: "PubMed search found only 2 articles, neither of which systematically enumerates the distinct nickel-containing chemical species in Rhea database. Literature discusses individual nickel enzymes and F430 biosynthesis, but lacks comprehensive cataloging of all nickel species across biochemical reactions. This question requires direct database querying with SPARQL to systematically identify all nickel compounds via compound name filtering and ChEBI cross-reference validation."

exact_answer: "6"

ideal_answer: |
  Rhea's biochemical reaction database catalogs six distinct nickel-containing chemical species. The simplest is the nickel(II) ion (Ni²⁺), which participates in five reactions including active transport across membranes and nickel incorporation into organic cofactors. The most complex is coenzyme F430, the nickel-tetrapyrrole prosthetic group essential for methanogenesis in archaea, with molecular formula C42H51N6NiO13+ and molecular weight 906.6 Da. Four biosynthetic intermediates in the F430 assembly pathway are also cataloged: Ni-sirohydrochlorin (the initial nickel-chelated tetrapyrrole), its a,c-diamide derivative, the ring-opened 15,17(3)-seco-F430-17(3)-acid precursor, and a specialized Ni(II)-pyridinium-3,5-bisthiocarboxylate mononucleotide complex. This chemical diversity, spanning simple ions to elaborate macrocyclic cofactors, reflects nickel's specialized biochemical roles in methanogenesis and redox metabolism, with each species serving distinct functions in enzyme catalysis or cofactor biosynthesis.
