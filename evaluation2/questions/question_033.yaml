    Searched PubMed with two targeted queries:
    (1) "gas vesicle proteins anaerobic bacteria genera BacDive culture collection oxygen tolerance"
    (2) "gas vesicle distribution anaerobic phototrophic bacteria Thiocapsa Cereibacter"
  result: |
    Both queries returned 0 results. No literature provides a
    compiled list of bacterial genera that carry both UniProt-annotated gas
    vesicle proteins (KW-0304) and BacDive-registered strains with anaerobic
    oxygen tolerance. Answering the question requires joining the current
    state of two live databases and cannot be recovered from published reviews.
  conclusion: PASS (cannot answer from literature - requires current database state)

exact_answer:
  - "Cereibacter (8 anaerobic strains in BacDive; purple non-sulfur phototrophic bacterium)"
  - "Geotalea (2 anaerobic strains in BacDive; sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacterium)"
  - "Streptomyces (1 anaerobic strain in BacDive; typically aerobic Actinobacteria)"
  - "Thiocapsa (7 anaerobic strains in BacDive; purple sulfur phototrophic bacterium)"

ideal_answer: |
  Of the 22 bacterial genera that include at least one reviewed UniProt protein annotated with the Gas vesicle keyword (KW-0304), exactly four contain strains with documented anaerobic oxygen requirements in BacDive: Cereibacter (8 anaerobic strains), Thiocapsa (7 anaerobic strains), Geotalea (2 anaerobic strains), and Streptomyces (1 anaerobic strain). The remaining 18 genera either lack BacDive oxygen tolerance records entirely (11 genera including Cyanobacteria such as Nostoc, Synechococcus, Microcystis, and Planktothrix, which are oxygenic phototrophs, as well as non-cyanobacterial genera Dactylococcopsis, Dolichospermum, Haloquadratum, Koribacter, Microchaete, Pseudanabaena, and Spirulina) or have BacDive oxygen tolerance records but no strictly anaerobic strains (Ancylobacter and Bradyrhizobium are exclusively aerobic or obligate aerobic; Haloferax, Halorubrum, and Priestia are exclusively aerobic or obligate aerobic; Halobacterium has one facultative anaerobe strain alongside aerobic strains; and Mycobacterium has 9 facultative anaerobe and 101 microaerophile strains alongside its 214 aerobic or obligate aerobic strains). The anaerobic genera span three physiologically distinct groups: Cereibacter and Thiocapsa are anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (purple non-sulfur and purple sulfur, respectively) that use light energy in the absence of oxygen, and their gas vesicles enable buoyancy positioning in stratified anoxic water columns below the oxycline; Geotalea (a genus closely allied to Geobacter) is a sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacterium that couples anaerobic respiration to metal reduction, with gas vesicles reported in at least one species; and the single anaerobic Streptomyces strain is exceptional within a genus overwhelmingly composed of aerobes (193 aerobic and 64 obligate-aerobic strains in BacDive, alongside 6 facultative anaerobes and 4 microaerophiles). This distribution demonstrates that gas vesicle formation is not restricted to aerobic or oxygenic lineages and has been co-opted in anoxic ecological niches — meromictic lakes, stratified fjords, and sulfidic sediments — where buoyancy regulation provides positional advantage in chemoclines rather than in oxygenated photic zones.
