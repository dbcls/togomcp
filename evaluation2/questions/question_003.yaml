training_knowledge_test:
  attempted_answer: "I know that heavily glycosylated proteins include immunoglobulins, mucins, and large receptors involved in endocytosis. Glycosylation is especially abundant on secreted and membrane proteins. However, I don't know which specific protein has the most characterized sites in Glycosmos, nor do I know the exact count of sites for any given protein in the current database."
  confidence_level: "low"
  knowledge_sources: "General biochemistry knowledge about protein glycosylation patterns and heavily glycosylated protein families, but no specific database content knowledge"
  requires_database: true
  reason: "This question requires systematic querying of Glycosmos to count glycosylation sites per protein and rank them. The answer depends on current database content (Glycosmos has 414,798 total glycosylation sites across 153,178 glycoproteins as of 2024.12 release). The specific count of 1,153 sites for Megalin is not knowledge I possess from training data, and would require aggregation across the glycoprotein graph in Glycosmos."
  decision: "PASS - proceeded to discovery"

  rationale: |
    Biological insight (3/3): Reveals that Megalin (LRP-2), a large endocytic receptor crucial for kidney function and lipoprotein metabolism, is the most extensively glycosylated human protein characterized to date. The extreme glycosylation (1,153 sites) likely reflects its role as a multi-ligand scavenger receptor requiring extensive post-translational modification for proper function and ligand recognition. This is clinically relevant as Megalin mutations cause Donnai-Barrow syndrome and mutations affecting its glycosylation could impact kidney function.
    
    Multi-database integration (3/3): Requires 3-database integration: (1) Glycosmos for comprehensive glycosylation site data across all human glycoproteins, (2) UniProt for protein identity and functional annotation (P98164 = Megalin/LRP-2), (3) PDB for structural context showing 5 structures including recent cryo-EM data. The integration demonstrates how glycosylation databases complement structural and functional protein databases to reveal post-translational modification patterns.
    
    Verifiability (3/3): Single, definitive answer with exact count (1,153 sites). Query results are systematically ranked by site count, making verification straightforward. The answer is unambiguous and reproducible through SPARQL aggregation on Glycosmos.
    
    RDF necessity (3/3): Impossible to answer without RDF graph queries. Requires: (1) aggregation across 414,798 total glycosylation sites to count per protein, (2) filtering by human taxonomy, (3) ranking by count, (4) cross-referencing to UniProt for protein identification. PubMed literature mentions Megalin glycosylation but provides no systematic enumeration of all sites (only 2 papers found, discussing O-glycosylation patterns but not total site counts).

  conclusion: "PubMed cannot answer this question. Only 2 papers discuss Megalin glycosylation: PMID 29559555 (2018) focuses on specific O-glycosylation sites affecting ligand binding, and PMID 16672230 (2006) discusses O-glycosylation of the hemopexin domain. Neither provides systematic enumeration of all 1,153 characterized sites. Answering this question requires comprehensive database aggregation across Glycosmos's complete glycosylation site dataset (414,798 total sites across all proteins), which is not available from literature review with reasonable effort."

exact_answer: "Megalin (Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2, LRP-2, UniProt P98164) with 1,153 characterized glycosylation sites"

ideal_answer: |
  Megalin (LRP-2, UniProt P98164), a large endocytic receptor primarily expressed in kidney proximal tubules, has the most characterized glycosylation sites of any human glycoprotein in Glycosmos with 1,153 documented sites. This extensive glycosylation substantially exceeds the second-most glycosylated protein (Uromodulin, P07911, with 966 sites) and reflects Megalin's massive ~600 kDa size and its role as a multi-ligand scavenger receptor responsible for reabsorbing lipoproteins, vitamin-binding proteins, albumin, and other filtered proteins from the glomerular filtrate. The heavy glycosylation likely contributes to proper folding of its 36 ligand-binding repeats, modulates ligand recognition across its diverse substrate repertoire, and protects the extracellular domain from proteolysis in the harsh kidney tubular environment. Structural studies including five PDB entries (2M0P, 8EM7, 8EM4, 9CWM, 9I3V) reveal the architecture of this heavily modified receptor, though the dynamic nature of glycan structures makes complete structural characterization of all glycosylation sites challenging. Megalin mutations cause Donnai-Barrow syndrome and Finnish congenital nephrosis, and understanding its glycosylation pattern may provide insights into disease mechanisms and the molecular basis of multi-ligand recognition by this clinically important receptor.
