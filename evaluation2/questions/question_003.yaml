  method: Searched "Rhea database ATP reactions count" and "biochemical reactions ATP substrate frequency" using search_articles. Retrieved metadata for 2 papers (PMIDs 15876357, 8396670).
  result: |
    Found 0 papers for first search, 2 papers for second search.
    Neither paper provides statistics about the number of ATP-involving reactions in biochemical databases.
    Papers discuss specific enzymatic mechanisms (ribonucleotide reductase, AAV Rep protein), not database composition or ATP reaction frequency.
  conclusion: PASS (cannot answer from literature - requires database queries)

exact_answer: 1327

ideal_answer: |
  There are 1,327 approved biochemical reactions in the Rhea database that involve ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate, CHEBI:30616) as a reactant. ATP serves as a universal energy currency and phosphate donor in cellular metabolism, participating in diverse reactions including phosphorylation, adenylation, ligation, and active transport. These reactions span all major metabolic pathways including glycolysis, protein and nucleic acid synthesis, signal transduction, and membrane transport. The comprehensive count reflects ATP's central role in energy metabolism across all domains of life.
