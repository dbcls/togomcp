biological_context:
  background: |
    Methylotrophic bacteria are organisms capable of utilizing methanol and other C1 compounds 
    as sole carbon and energy sources. These bacteria span diverse taxonomic groups and occupy 
    various ecological niches, from mesophilic soil inhabitants to thermophilic hot spring dwellers.
    
    Growth temperature is a critical physiological parameter that defines bacterial niche specialization. 
    Thermophilic methylotrophs like Methylothermus species have evolved specialized enzymes and 
    membrane adaptations to maintain metabolic activity at high temperatures.
    
    BacDive catalogs strain-level growth conditions for >97,000 bacterial and archaeal strains, 
    making it possible to systematically compare physiological properties across diverse taxa 
    that would be scattered across hundreds of individual research papers.
  
  significance: |
    Understanding temperature limits of methylotrophs is important for:
    - Biotechnology applications (methanol-based biofuel production)
    - Environmental remediation (methanol degradation in various climates)
    - Microbial ecology (niche partitioning among methylotrophs)
    - Astrobiology (methane-utilizing life in extreme environments)
    
    This question showcases BacDive's PRIMARY capability: comprehensive strain-level physiological 
    data that enables comparative analyses impossible through literature alone.

          pmids: []
      limitations:
        - "No comprehensive comparative studies across all methylotrophic genera"
        - "Individual papers report single strains/species without systematic comparison"
        - "Data scattered across hundreds of papers with inconsistent reporting"

        - "Standardized data format (schema:CultureTemperature)"
        - "Comprehensive coverage: 20+ genera, 400+ strains"

  why_pubmed_insufficient: |
    PubMed searches cannot answer this question because:
    1. No single review comprehensively compares growth temperatures across ALL methylotrophic genera
    2. Individual papers report isolated strains without systematic inter-genus comparisons
    3. Data is scattered: Methylothermus papers don't cite Bacillus methylotrophs
    4. Literature bias: Novel thermophiles are published, but comprehensive surveys are not
    5. Requires aggregating data from 400+ strains across 20+ genera
    
    BacDive uniquely provides:
    - Standardized growth temperature data for 97,000+ strains
    - Full-text keyword search (bif:contains) to identify methylotrophs
    - Structured properties (schema:hasTemperatureRangeStart) for quantitative comparison
    - Comprehensive coverage enabling genus-level MAX/AVG aggregations
    
    This question REQUIRES BacDive's systematic strain catalog - it cannot be answered 
    from scattered literature or protein databases.

      - "schema:describesStrain linking phenotypes to strains"
    why_primary: |
      BacDive is PRIMARY because this question SHOWCASES its unique capability:
      - Systematic catalog of growth temperatures for 97,000+ bacterial strains
      - Enables genus-level MAX/AVG aggregations across 400+ methylotrophs
      - Standardized data format for quantitative comparisons
      - Cannot be replicated from protein databases or literature
      - No other database provides comprehensive strain-level growth conditions
    coverage: "400+ methylotrophic strains across 20+ genera with temperature data"
  
  taxonomy:
    role: "SECONDARY"
    contribution: "Genus classification context (already in BacDive strain records)"
    why_secondary: "Taxonomic information is embedded in BacDive Strain entities (schema:hasGenus). Taxonomy database not required for this question."

question_design_rationale:
  why_choice_format: |
    Choice format is ideal because:
    1. Tests understanding of comparative bacterial physiology
    2. Requires distinguishing thermophilic vs. mesophilic methylotrophs
    3. Plausible distractors (Bacillus is thermophilic but not highest)
    4. Cannot be guessed without systematic data analysis
    5. Demonstrates BacDive's power for genus-level comparisons
  
  why_bacdive_primary: |
    This question FEATURES BacDive as PRIMARY database by:
    1. Requiring strain-level growth condition data (BacDive's core strength)
    2. Comparing physiological properties across diverse genera
    3. Avoiding protein-centric approaches (no UniProt needed)
    4. Showcasing full-text search + structured property queries
    5. Demonstrating unique value: comprehensive strain catalog
  
  why_avoids_uniprot: |
    Question intentionally avoids UniProt by:
    - Focusing on strain-level physiology, not protein properties
    - Requiring growth temperature data, not protein sequences/functions
    - Comparing bacterial strains, not individual proteins
    - Using BacDive's unique strain catalog, not protein databases
    - Achieving balance: UniProt stays at 45.9% (17/38), below 50% threshold
