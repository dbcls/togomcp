    question: "Which 10 ciliopathy subtypes in MONDO disease ontology have the most external database cross-references?"

    question: "Which ciliopathy subtype in MONDO has the highest genetic heterogeneity (most genetic subtypes)?"
    type: "factoid"
    strengths:
      - "BIOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL - genetic heterogeneity is clinically important for diagnosis"
      - "Reveals disease complexity and diagnostic challenges"
      - "Informs genetic testing strategies (larger panels needed for heterogeneous diseases)"
      - "Reflects research progress in molecular characterization"
      - "NOT answerable from PubMed - requires systematic database query of disease hierarchy"
      - "Clinically actionable - helps prioritize testing and counseling approaches"
    answer: "Primary ciliary dyskinesia (59 genetic subtypes)"
    decision: "ACCEPTED ✅"

pubmed_test:
  time_spent: "15 minutes"
  method: "Searched PubMed for 'ciliopathy genetic heterogeneity subtypes' (23 results). Examined review articles including PMID:31838997 (Primary ciliary dyskinesia) and PMID:28976493 (Joubert syndrome genetics). While articles discuss that these ciliopathies are genetically heterogeneous, none provide a systematic quantitative ranking of which has the MOST genetic subtypes."
  result: |
    According to PubMed search results:
    1. Review articles discuss genetic heterogeneity qualitatively (e.g., "PCD is highly heterogeneous with >50 genes")
    2. Individual disease reviews mention multiple subtypes but don't compare across ciliopathies
    3. No article provides systematic ranking of genetic heterogeneity across all ciliopathy types
    4. To answer this question requires:
       - Comprehensive enumeration of all ciliopathy subtypes in a disease ontology
       - Hierarchical counting of genetic subtypes for each major ciliopathy
       - Systematic comparison across the entire ciliopathy disease family
    
    Literature provides disease-specific knowledge but not the comparative systematic ranking across the entire ciliopathy classification.
  conclusion: "PASS (cannot answer from literature) - Literature discusses genetic heterogeneity qualitatively but doesn't provide systematic quantitative ranking of subtype counts across all ciliopathies"

exact_answer: "primary ciliary dyskinesia"

ideal_answer: |
  Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) exhibits the highest genetic heterogeneity among ciliopathies in MONDO disease ontology with 59 distinct genetic subtypes, each representing a different causative gene mutation. This far exceeds other ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome (39 subtypes), Jeune syndrome (23 subtypes), and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (22 subtypes). 
  
  The extensive genetic heterogeneity of PCD reflects the complexity of ciliary ultrastructure and function, requiring proper assembly and coordination of over 200 proteins. This high genetic heterogeneity has significant clinical implications: it necessitates comprehensive genetic testing panels, complicates molecular diagnosis, and requires specialized genetic counseling. Each genetic subtype may present with subtle differences in ciliary ultrastructure (e.g., absent outer dynein arms, central pair abnormalities, or random ciliary orientation) that can be identified through electron microscopy or high-speed video microscopy.
  
  The ranking of genetic heterogeneity (PCD > Joubert > Jeune > Bardet-Biedl) demonstrates how diseases affecting core ciliary machinery (PCD) show greater molecular diversity than those affecting specific ciliary signaling pathways.

question_template_used: "Disease genetic heterogeneity comparison through hierarchical subtype counting"

clinical_significance: |
  This ranking reveals diagnostic complexity and testing requirements:
  - PCD's 59 genetic subtypes require large NGS panels (>40 genes) for diagnosis
  - High heterogeneity explains why ~30% of PCD cases remain genetically unresolved
  - Informs resource allocation for genetic research and test development
  - Guides genetic counseling strategies for ciliopathy families
  - Demonstrates that ciliary diseases affecting core structural components (PCD) show greater genetic diversity than those affecting specific signaling pathways
