question_type: factoid
keyword:
  id: KW-0325
  name: "Glycoprotein"
  category: "PTM"
question: "Which human protein has the most glycosylation sites in Glycosmos?"
answer: "P98164 (Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2, also known as LRP2 or Megalin) with 1,153 glycosylation sites"
database_usage:
  primary:
    - glycosmos
  referenced: []
  why_primary_needed: "Glycosmos maintains the comprehensive database of glycosylation sites (414,798 sites total). The question requires counting glycosylation sites per protein and finding the maximum, which cannot be obtained from literature or other databases. This showcases Glycosmos's unique capability in cataloging and analyzing glycosylation data at scale."
rdf_necessity:
  requires_rdf: true
  why_rdf_needed: "This question requires structured database querying across all human glycoproteins in Glycosmos to aggregate glycosylation sites per protein and identify the maximum. PubMed search confirms no literature directly answers this specific database statistic about which protein has the most sites. The answer (1,153 sites on LRP2) is a database-derived fact requiring SPARQL aggregation."
  pubmed_test:
    query: "LRP2 megalin glycosylation sites count human maximum most"
    results: "0 results found"
    conclusion: "PubMed does not contain papers answering which protein has the most glycosylation sites. General papers about glycosylation exist but none provide this comparative statistic across all human glycoproteins."

    Run SPARQL query on Glycosmos to count glycosylation sites per human protein:
    
    PREFIX glycan: <http://purl.jp/bio/12/glyco/glycan#>
    PREFIX glycoconjugate: <http://purl.jp/bio/12/glyco/conjugate#>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    
    SELECT ?protein ?label (COUNT(DISTINCT ?site) as ?siteCount)
    FROM <http://rdf.glycosmos.org/glycoprotein>
    WHERE {
      ?protein a glycan:Glycoprotein ;
        glycan:has_taxon <http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/9606> ;
        glycoconjugate:glycosylated_at ?site .
      OPTIONAL { ?protein rdfs:label ?label }
    }
    GROUP BY ?protein ?label
    ORDER BY DESC(?siteCount)
    LIMIT 10

scope:
  is_bounded: true
  scope_description: "Question asks for a single answer - the protein with maximum glycosylation sites among human proteins in Glycosmos database. The answer is objectively verifiable by counting sites per protein and sorting."
discovery_process:
  tools_used:
    - tool: "togomcp_local:get_MIE_file"
      purpose: "Read Glycosmos MIE file to understand schema and kw_search_tools (found: sparql)"
    - tool: "togomcp_local:run_sparql"
      purpose: "Query glycosylation sites per human protein to find maximum"
    - tool: "PubMed:search_articles"
      purpose: "Verify that PubMed cannot answer this question"
  keyword_selection_rationale: "KW-0325 (Glycoprotein) is a PTM category keyword directly relevant to glycosylation. Glycosmos specializes in glycobiology data including glycoproteins and their glycosylation sites, making this a perfect domain match."
  mie_guidance_followed: "Yes - MIE file specified kw_search_tools: [sparql], so I used SPARQL directly for discovery rather than an external search API"

notes:
  - "This is a single-database question showcasing Glycosmos's unique glycosylation site catalog"
  - "LRP2/Megalin (P98164) is a large endocytic receptor with an exceptionally high number of glycosylation sites"
  - "The MIE file mentioned max 276 sites, but current data shows 1,153 for P98164, suggesting database updates or different query scope"
  - "Top 10 proteins by site count: P98164 (1153), P07911 (966), P13473 (938), Q07954 (934), P01833 (863), O60494 (837), P11279 (808), P10909 (725), P07602 (692), P02751 (673)"
  - "This question advances Glycosmos from 2.8% to 5.6% usage (1→2 questions)"
  - "Single-database questions now 13.5% (5/37) - within acceptable limits"
  - "FACTOID advances to 70% (7/10)"
score:
  verifiability: 3
  rdf_necessity: 3
  scope: 3
  total: 9
  reasoning: "Perfect 9/9 - Objectively verifiable with single answer (P98164), requires RDF database aggregation that PubMed cannot provide, and has bounded scope (maximum among human proteins)"
