  result: |
    Found experimental studies showing which endocytic pathways are used in specific contexts:
    - PMID 39709939: Nanoparticle uptake under iontophoresis conditions
    - PMID 39442088: Resistant starch nanoparticle internalization mechanisms
    
    However, these articles:
    1. Focus on experimental observations in specific cell types/conditions
    2. Do not provide systematic comparison of general mechanisms across all three pathways
    3. Do not enumerate key regulatory proteins or cargo selectivity patterns systematically
    4. Are context-dependent rather than comprehensive mechanistic comparisons
    
    The question requires systematic synthesis from GO process definitions, Reactome pathway components, and documented cargo specificities not comprehensively available in any single PubMed article.
  conclusion: "PASS (cannot answer from literature)"

  The three major endocytic pathways exhibit distinct mechanistic features. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis uses clathrin-coated pits that form structured vesicles approximately 100-150 nm in diameter, with cargo recognition mediated by adaptor proteins (AP-2, arrestins, DAB2) that bind specific motifs on receptors like LDLR and GPCRs. Caveolin-mediated endocytosis utilizes flask-shaped plasma membrane caveolae enriched in caveolin proteins, forming smaller carriers (50-70 nm) that preferentially internalize lipid-raft-associated proteins and some viruses through lipid-based cargo selectivity. Macropinocytosis differs fundamentally as it involves actin-driven membrane ruffling to form large, heterogeneously-sized macropinosomes (up to 5 micrometers), providing non-selective uptake of extracellular fluid, solutes, and large particles like exosomes. Each pathway shows specialized biological contexts: clathrin predominates in receptor-mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling, caveolin in lipid homeostasis and some viral entry, and macropinocytosis in immune surveillance and nutrient sampling.
