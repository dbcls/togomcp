    query: "blood coagulation inhibitor snake venom"
    result: "Found 20 snake venom proteins with anticoagulant functions including metalloproteinases, disintegrins, serine proteases from various genera (Micropechis, Echis, Gloydius, Vipera, Bothrops, Daboia, Protobothrops, Oxyuranus, Ophiophagus). Discovery reveals cross-references to PDB structures via rdfs:seeAlso property. Discovered entity IDs used to map between UniProt proteins and Taxonomy classification via organism taxon IDs."

training_knowledge_test:
  attempted_answer: "I know that viper venoms (Viperidae family) contain many anticoagulant proteins. Some specific examples I recall include metalloproteinases and disintegrins. Genera that might have many structures include Bothrops (lance-headed vipers), Crotalus (rattlesnakes), and possibly Naja (cobras - though these are more neurotoxic). However, I don't know the SPECIFIC COUNT of PDB structures per genus or which genus has the MOST structures. I would need to systematically count current PDB deposits across all snake anticoagulant proteins and aggregate by genus."
  confidence_level: "low"
  knowledge_sources: "General herpetology and venom biochemistry knowledge about venom composition and protein families, but no systematic knowledge of current PDB structure coverage by genus"
  requires_database: true
  reason: "This question requires (1) current PDB structure counts which change as new structures are deposited monthly, (2) systematic cross-database integration between UniProt protein annotations, PDB structure cross-references, and Taxonomy genus classification, (3) quantitative aggregation and ranking that cannot be derived from literature or training knowledge. While I know general venom composition, I cannot reliably rank genera by structure count without querying databases."
  decision: "PASS - proceeded to discovery"

  rationale: |
    Biological insight (3/3): Reveals which snake lineages have had their anticoagulant mechanisms most extensively characterized at atomic resolution. Daboia (Russell's vipers) dominating with 69 structures indicates their medical importance and research priority. The ranking (Daboia > Bothrops > Protobothrops > Gloydius > Bungarus) reflects both clinical significance and structural biology research effort in Asian and South American pit vipers.
    
    Multi-database integration (2/3): Requires 2 databases with clear integration pattern: Search API discovery of UniProt proteins with KW-1203 keyword → Extract organism taxon IDs from UniProt → SPARQL validation of PDB cross-references (rdfs:seeAlso) → Count structures per protein → Query Taxonomy to map taxon IDs to genus rank → Aggregate structure counts by genus → Rank top 5. Integration via shared taxon ID identifiers linking UniProt organisms to Taxonomy classification.
    
    Verifiability (3/3): Bounded list of exactly 5 genera with definitive structure counts: Daboia (69), Bothrops (12), Protobothrops (11), Gloydius (6), Bungarus (5). Each count verifiable by querying UniProt for proteins with KW-1203 + PDB cross-references + specific genus taxonomy.
    
    RDF necessity (3/3): Impossible without graph queries. Requires: (1) Graph traversal from UniProt proteins → PDB structures via rdfs:seeAlso cross-references, (2) Cross-database JOIN via organism taxon IDs, (3) Taxonomy hierarchical classification via rdfs:subClassOf to genus rank, (4) Aggregation by genus with COUNT. Literature has individual protein studies but no systematic ranking. Training knowledge knows venom families but not current PDB coverage statistics.

  conclusion: |
    PubMed search found 93 papers on snake venom anticoagulants and structures (second query) but zero systematic comparisons across genera (first and third queries returned no results). Literature contains individual protein structural studies but lacks:
    (1) Systematic genus-level aggregation of structure counts across all anticoagulant proteins
    (2) Current comprehensive ranking requiring up-to-date PDB cross-reference data
    (3) Quantitative comparison answering "which 5 genera have MOST structures"
    
    The question requires real-time database integration: UniProt keyword classification (KW-1203) → PDB structure cross-references (rdfs:seeAlso) → Taxonomy genus aggregation → quantitative ranking. This systematic integration across protein function, structural biology, and taxonomy databases is not available through literature search with reasonable effort. Papers focus on individual proteins or families, not comprehensive genus-level structural coverage statistics.

exact_answer: "Daboia (69 PDB structures), Bothrops (12 structures), Protobothrops (11 structures), Gloydius (6 structures), Bungarus (5 structures)"

ideal_answer: |
  The five snake genera with the most structurally characterized anticoagulant venom proteins are Daboia (69 PDB structures), Bothrops (12 structures), Protobothrops (11 structures), Gloydius (6 structures), and Bungarus (5 structures). Daboia's dominance reflects the medical significance of Russell's viper envenomation across Asia and extensive structural studies of its phospholipase A2-based anticoagulants, particularly from D. russelii where a single protein (P59071) accounts for 68 structures representing different ligand complexes and functional states. The prevalence of pit viper genera (Bothrops from South America, Protobothrops and Gloydius from East Asia) in positions 2-4 demonstrates concentrated structural biology research on medically important Crotalinae venoms, while Bungarus (kraits) at position 5 shows that even primarily neurotoxic snakes possess structurally characterized anticoagulant components that contribute to the hemorrhagic syndrome of envenomation.
