  result: |
    First search returned 224 papers about cell cycle kinases in general (cancer research, 
    specific kinase studies, drug development). No papers providing comprehensive count of 
    proteins with BOTH cell cycle keyword AND kinase activity GO annotation.
    
    Second search returned 0 papers - no publications documenting this specific database 
    annotation intersection statistic.
  conclusion: PASS (cannot answer from literature - this is database metadata, not published research)

exact_answer: 13

ideal_answer: |
  There are 13 human proteins that are both involved in cell cycle regulation and possess kinase activity. These proteins represent the cell cycle kinases, which are crucial regulators of cell division including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDK7), Aurora kinases (Aurora A, Aurora B), Polo-like kinases (PLK1), checkpoint kinases (CHK1, CHK2), and WEE1 kinase. These kinases are master regulators of cell cycle transitions, integrating growth signals with DNA replication and chromosome segregation, and enforcing cell cycle checkpoints to prevent genomic instability. Their dysregulation drives cancer through uncontrolled proliferation, making them major therapeutic targets. CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib) are FDA-approved for breast cancer, Aurora kinase inhibitors are in clinical trials for hematological malignancies, and WEE1 inhibitors are being developed to sensitize tumors to DNA-damaging agents. Understanding this complete set helps identify redundant pathways that could cause drug resistance, combination therapy opportunities, and novel targets for cancer treatment.
