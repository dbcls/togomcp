training_knowledge_test:
  attempted_answer: "I know that dihydroorotate dehydrogenase exists in multiple forms with different electron acceptors (quinone, fumarate, NAD+), and that quinone-dependent forms are common in eukaryotes while fumarate-dependent forms exist in some fungi and protozoa. However, I don't know the EXACT current counts of characterized enzymes for each type across all organisms in UniProt."
  confidence_level: "medium"
  knowledge_sources: "General biochemistry knowledge about DHODH enzyme variants and their distribution"

  reason: "Requires current systematic enumeration of enzyme counts by EC number across all characterized organisms. Training knowledge knows the enzyme types exist but cannot provide quantitative comparison of prevalence without querying UniProt database for current counts."

  rationale: |
    Biological insight (3): Reveals metabolic diversity in pyrimidine biosynthesis across organisms. Quinone-dependent DHODH being most prevalent (393 vs 98 vs 40 enzymes) reflects the predominance of respiratory chain-linked pyrimidine synthesis in eukaryotes and many bacteria, while NAD+/fumarate-dependent forms represent alternative metabolic strategies in specific lineages.
    
    Multi-database (2): Requires 2 databases - Rhea to identify DHODH reaction types and their EC numbers, UniProt to count characterized enzymes for each EC number. Integration via EC number cross-references.
    
    Verifiability (3): Single factoid answer (quinone with 393 enzymes) with complete counts for all four electron acceptor types.
    
    RDF necessity (3): Impossible without database queries. Requires: (1) comprehensive Rhea catalog of DHODH reactions by EC number, (2) systematic UniProt enzyme counts by EC number across all organisms, (3) linking via EC number identifiers. Literature discusses enzyme types qualitatively but provides no systematic quantitative enumeration across databases.

  conclusion: "PubMed articles discuss DHODH biochemistry and the existence of different enzyme types (quinone-dependent, NAD+-dependent, fumarate-dependent), but provide NO systematic enumeration of enzyme counts by electron acceptor type across all characterized organisms. Literature focuses on individual enzymes or specific organisms, not comprehensive database-wide quantitative comparisons. Answering this question requires querying Rhea for reaction EC numbers and UniProt for current enzyme counts - impossible from literature with reasonable effort."

exact_answer: "Quinone (used by 393 characterized dihydroorotate dehydrogenase enzymes, EC 1.3.5.2)"

ideal_answer: |
  Quinone-dependent dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.5.2) is used by 393 characterized enzymes across organisms, making quinone the most prevalent electron acceptor type by a significant margin. This far exceeds NAD+-dependent forms (EC 1.3.1.14, 98 enzymes), fumarate-dependent forms (EC 1.3.98.1, 40 enzymes), and NADP+-dependent forms (EC 1.3.1.15, 0 characterized enzymes). The predominance of quinone-dependent DHODH reflects its widespread distribution in eukaryotic mitochondria where it links pyrimidine biosynthesis to the respiratory electron transport chain via ubiquinone, as well as its presence in many bacterial respiratory systems. In contrast, NAD+-dependent DHODH represents an alternative metabolic strategy found predominantly in certain bacteria like Bacillus and Lactococcus that use soluble NAD+ rather than membrane-bound quinones, while fumarate-dependent DHODH is characteristic of anaerobic or microaerophilic organisms including some fungi (Saccharomyces) and protozoan parasites (Trypanosoma) that use fumarate as an alternative terminal electron acceptor when oxygen is limited.
