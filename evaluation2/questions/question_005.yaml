    query: "WNK1 human"
    result: "Found Q9H4A3 - Serine/threonine-protein kinase WNK1 (EC 2.7.11.1). Confirmed it is a serine/threonine kinase with enzymatic activity for phosphorylating serine and threonine residues."
    purpose: "Validated that Q9H4A3 (found in Glycosmos) is indeed WNK1 and confirmed its classification as a serine/threonine kinase."

training_knowledge_test:
  attempted_answer: "I know WNK1 is a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating ion channels and blood pressure (mutations cause Gordon's syndrome). However, I do not know specific glycosylation site counts for WNK1 or any other human kinase. I cannot rank kinases by number of glycosylation sites from my training knowledge."
  confidence_level: "low"
  knowledge_sources: "General biochemistry knowledge about kinases and glycosylation as a post-translational modification. Awareness that membrane-associated and secreted kinases often undergo glycosylation. No specific quantitative data on glycosylation site counts across the kinome."
  requires_database: true
  reason: "Answering this question requires: (1) Systematic enumeration of all human serine/threonine kinases, (2) Glycosylation site count for each kinase from experimental glycoproteomics data, (3) Ranking by site count. This data is curated in specialized glycoproteomics databases like Glycosmos but not available in textbooks or my training knowledge. Individual kinases may have published site counts, but systematic comparison across all kinases requires database aggregation."
  decision: "PASS - proceeded to discovery"

  rationale: |
    Biological Insight (3/3): Reveals which kinase undergoes the most extensive glycosylation modification. WNK1 (With No Lysine kinase 1) is a master regulator of ion homeostasis and blood pressure. Its 76 glycosylation sites suggest extensive post-translational modification that likely affects protein folding, stability, trafficking, and regulatory interactions. This is clinically relevant because WNK1 mutations cause Gordon's syndrome (pseudohypoaldosteronism type II), a hereditary form of hypertension. Understanding that WNK1 is heavily glycosylated provides insights into why this kinase may be particularly sensitive to glycosylation defects in congenital disorders of glycosylation.
    
    Multi-Database Integration (2/3): Integrates Glycosmos (glycoprotein data with site counts) and UniProt (kinase classification validation). Integration method: (1) Query Glycosmos for human glycoproteins with "serine/threonine" and "kinase" in label, (2) Count glycosylation sites per protein, (3) Rank by site count, (4) Validate top result in UniProt to confirm kinase classification and enzymatic activity. Two databases with clear data flow via UniProt ID Q9H4A3.
    
    Verifiability (3/3): Single definitive answer (WNK1 with 76 sites). Can be verified by running SPARQL COUNT query on Glycosmos filtering for human S/T kinases and ranking by glycosylation site count. Answer is unambiguous and reproducible.
    
    RDF Necessity (3/3): Requires graph database operations: (1) Filtering by taxonomy (human), (2) Text filtering by protein name (serine/threonine kinase), (3) Aggregation (COUNT of glycosylation sites per protein), (4) Ranking (ORDER BY site count), (5) Cross-reference validation via UniProt IDs. Cannot answer from PubMed - literature contains scattered individual kinase studies but no systematic comparison of glycosylation site counts across the entire human kinome. Cannot answer from training knowledge - specific site counts change with new experimental data and require current database state.

  conclusion: |
    Cannot answer from PubMed with reasonable effort. Three search strategies attempted:
    
    1. Specific WNK1 search: Found only 1 paper (PMID 23443134) mentioning WNK1 glycosylation, but no comprehensive site count or comparison to other kinases.
    
    2. Systematic comparison search: Found only 1 paper from 2000 (PMID 10860807) on kinase glycosylation site counting - outdated and not comprehensive.
    
    3. Proteomics search: Found 34 papers on kinase glycosylation proteomics, but examined recent paper (PMID 40781862) which focuses on MUC2 mucin and goblet cells, not systematic kinase comparison.
    
    Key gap: PubMed literature contains individual kinase glycosylation studies but lacks systematic comparative analysis ranking all human S/T kinases by glycosylation site count. To answer from literature would require: (1) Finding papers on each of ~500 human S/T kinases, (2) Extracting site count data (often incomplete), (3) Manual aggregation across hundreds of papers, (4) Dealing with missing data for many kinases. This is impractical.
    
    Glycosmos provides curated, systematic glycoproteomics data from multiple experimental sources (UniProt, GlyGen, GlyConnect, ACGG GPDB2, O-GlcNAc Database) aggregated into a single queryable RDF graph. This enables systematic ranking across all documented kinases.

exact_answer: "WNK1 (Serine/threonine-protein kinase WNK1, UniProt ID: Q9H4A3) with 76 documented glycosylation sites"

ideal_answer: |
  WNK1 (With No Lysine kinase 1) has the most glycosylation sites among human serine/threonine kinases, with 76 documented sites in Glycosmos - 69% more than the second-ranked kinase FAM20C (45 sites). WNK1 is a master regulator of ion homeostasis controlling renal sodium and potassium transport through phosphorylation of sodium-chloride cotransporters and potassium channels. The extensive glycosylation of WNK1 likely plays critical roles in protein folding, stability, intracellular trafficking, and protein-protein interactions necessary for its regulatory functions. Mutations in WNK1 cause Gordon's syndrome (pseudohypoaldosteronism type II), an autosomal dominant form of hypertension characterized by hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, underscoring the clinical importance of proper WNK1 regulation. The exceptional glycosylation extent suggests that WNK1 may be particularly vulnerable to glycosylation defects in congenital disorders of glycosylation, and that glycosylation status could represent a novel regulatory mechanism for modulating WNK1 activity in cardiovascular disease.
