question:
  body: "Which 5 genes have the most pathogenic variants associated with chronic granulomatous disease in ClinVar?"
  
ideal_answer:
  body: |
    The 5 genes with the most pathogenic variants associated with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in ClinVar, in descending order by variant count, are:
    1. CYBB (cytochrome b-245 beta chain) - 381 pathogenic variants - X-linked, encodes gp91-phox
    2. CYBA (cytochrome b-245 alpha chain) - 165 pathogenic variants - autosomal recessive, encodes p22-phox
    3. NCF2 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 2) - 124 pathogenic variants - autosomal recessive, encodes p67-phox
    4. NCF1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1) - 87 pathogenic variants - autosomal recessive, encodes p47-phox
    5. NCF4 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 4) - 58 pathogenic variants - autosomal recessive, encodes p40-phox
    
    All five genes encode components of the NADPH oxidase complex, which is essential for the oxidative burst in phagocytes. Mutations in any of these genes cause chronic granulomatous disease, an inherited immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections.

biological_context:
  disease_mechanism: |
    Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited immunodeficiency disorder caused by defects in the NADPH oxidase complex. This enzyme complex is responsible for the "oxidative burst" - the production of reactive oxygen species (superoxide) that phagocytes use to kill ingested bacteria and fungi. The NADPH oxidase complex consists of:
    - Membrane components: CYBB (gp91-phox) and CYBA (p22-phox) forming cytochrome b558
    - Cytosolic components: NCF1 (p47-phox), NCF2 (p67-phox), and NCF4 (p40-phox)
    
    Patients with CGD have phagocytes that can ingest microorganisms but cannot kill them effectively, leading to recurrent life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections, particularly with catalase-positive organisms like Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus species.
    
  inheritance_patterns:
    - "X-linked CGD (60-70% of cases): CYBB mutations, affecting males primarily"
    - "Autosomal recessive CGD (30-40% of cases): CYBA, NCF1, NCF2, or NCF4 mutations, affecting both sexes equally"
    
  variant_distribution_rationale: |
    CYBB has the highest variant count (381) because:
    1. It's the most common cause of CGD (X-linked form accounts for 60-70% of cases)
    2. It's a larger gene (13 exons, ~33kb) providing more opportunities for mutations
    3. X-linked inheritance means hemizygous males are affected by single mutations
    4. The gene has been studied extensively since the 1980s
    
    The autosomal recessive genes have progressively fewer variants reflecting their relative clinical frequencies:
    - CYBA: Second most common (~25% of CGD cases)
    - NCF1: Third most common (~20% of CGD cases)
    - NCF2: Rare (~5% of CGD cases)
    - NCF4: Very rare (<5% of CGD cases)
