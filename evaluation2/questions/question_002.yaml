  method: "Tested two search strategies: (1) 'human iron protein structure PDB count' and (2) 'iron binding proteins structural database statistics'"
  result: "Query 1 returned 1 result that did not provide the specific count. Query 2 returned 15 results about iron-binding proteins and structural databases in general, but none answered the specific quantitative question."
  conclusion: "PASS (cannot answer) - PubMed has relevant literature but cannot provide the exact count of reviewed human proteins with iron-related function that have PDB structures. This requires cross-database integration and aggregation."

  # Database: uniprot | Query: 1 | Links reviewed human protein with iron keyword to PDB structures

exact_answer: "276"

ideal_answer: |
  There are 276 reviewed human proteins with iron-related function that have at least one experimentally determined 3D structure in the Protein Data Bank. This count includes proteins classified with the iron keyword (KW-0408) or proteins with iron-related function annotations. The integration leverages UniProt's curated cross-references to PDB structures via rdfs:seeAlso properties, enabling comprehensive counting of iron-containing proteins with available structural data.
