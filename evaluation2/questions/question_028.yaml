reasoning_for_score: |
  Verifiability (3/3): 
  - Completely objective - counts distinct approved biochemical reactions per EC class
  - Bounded by human proteome and curated Rhea reaction database
  - Clear winning class: EC 1 (68 reactions) >> EC 4 (7) > EC 3 (6) > EC 2 (1)
  
  RDF Necessity (3/3):
  - Requires systematic enumeration of iron-containing proteins from UniProt
  - Needs EC classification from enzyme property
  - Requires cross-database join to Rhea for reaction counting
  - PubMed has iron enzyme papers but no systematic EC class comparison
  
  Scope (3/3):
  - Well-defined constraint: reviewed human proteins with KW-0408 (Iron)
  - Clear classification: EC 1-4 enzyme classes
  - Finite result set: 117 iron enzymes across 4 EC classes
  - Unambiguous metric: count of distinct approved Rhea reactions

exact_answer: "EC 1.* (Oxidoreductases)"

ideal_answer: |
  EC 1.* (Oxidoreductases) catalyzes the most distinct biochemical reactions among iron-containing human proteins, with 68 distinct approved reactions in Rhea. This is substantially more than EC 4.* (Lyases) with 7 reactions, EC 3.* (Hydrolases) with 6 reactions, and EC 2.* (Transferases) with only 1 reaction. The dominance of oxidoreductases reflects the critical role of iron in redox chemistry, particularly in electron transfer reactions, hydroxylation, and oxygen activation. Iron-containing oxidoreductases include important enzyme families such as cytochrome P450s, iron-sulfur proteins, and dioxygenases that catalyze diverse metabolic transformations.
