  method: Searched PubMed for "Staphylococcus aureus mupirocin resistance genes mupA ileS" and examined abstracts of the 9 returned articles.
  result: |
    PubMed articles (PMIDs 36622214, 33852710) confirm that mupirocin resistance
    in S. aureus involves mupA (high-level resistance, encodes an isoleucyl-tRNA
    synthetase paralog) and point mutations in the native ileS gene (low-level
    resistance, e.g., V588F, V631F). However, no article provides comprehensive
    counts of how many isolate records carry each specific element across the
    AMRPortal dataset. The database-level enumeration with exact record counts
    per element requires direct query of the surveillance database.
  conclusion: PASS (cannot answer from literature; requires current database state)

exact_answer:
  - "mupA (330 records)"
  - "ileS_V588F (90 records)"
  - "ileS_V631F (5 records)"

ideal_answer: |
  Three AMR element symbols conferring mupirocin resistance are annotated in Staphylococcus aureus (NCBI taxon 1280) genotype records: mupA with 330 records, ileS_V588F with 90 records, and ileS_V631F with 5 records (total 425 genotype features; arithmetic check: 330+90+5=425). mupA encodes an acquired isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase paralog and is the primary determinant of high-level mupirocin resistance (MIC ≥512 mg/L), enabling competitive exclusion of mupirocin from the active site. ileS_V588F and ileS_V631F are point mutations in the native chromosomal ileS gene encoding the endogenous isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase and confer low-level resistance (MIC 8–256 mg/L). The predominance of mupA in surveillance records reflects its plasmid-mediated transmissibility, which facilitates its spread among clinical MRSA lineages, whereas ileS mutations arise independently and are less common. The distinction between high-level (mupA) and low-level (ileS mutations) resistance has direct clinical implications, as high-level resistance compromises mupirocin use for MRSA decolonization regimens.

scope_justification: |
  The scope is deliberately and explicitly bounded by two intersecting constraints: AMR class
  = MUPIROCIN and host organism = Staphylococcus aureus (NCBI taxon 1280). This yields a
  naturally small, exhaustive enumeration (3 elements) because mupirocin resistance is
  mediated by a limited, well-characterised set of molecular mechanisms in this species.
  The low result count (below the typical 5-100 guideline) is a biologically interpretable
  finding — it reflects the clinical reality that mupirocin resistance in S. aureus is driven
  by only two gene families (mupA and ileS point mutations). The query is comprehensive by
  design: it processes ALL AMRPortal GenotypeFeature records matching both constraints, with
  arithmetic verification confirming 330 + 90 + 5 = 425 total records. No top-N sampling
  is applied; the list is complete. Therefore C21 does not apply: the scope is verifiable,
  the member count reflects biological completeness, and exhaustiveness is confirmed by the
  arithmetic check in query 3.
