    Search 1: "inflammatory signaling pathway reaction count comparison" - 5 results
    - Found general pathway studies but no systematic reaction enumeration
    - Articles focused on specific signaling mechanisms (PTEN/Akt, TIM-3/Gal-9)
    - No quantitative pathway complexity comparisons
    
    Search 2: "TNF interleukin TLR4 interferon pathway biochemical reactions Reactome" - 0 results
    - Zero results for comprehensive pathway reaction analysis
    - No literature systematically counts reactions across these pathways
    - Reactome database structure not documented in searchable literature
  conclusion: "PASS - Cannot answer from literature. Requires direct RDF database access to count reactions within hierarchical pathway structures. Literature discusses pathway mechanisms but does not provide quantitative reaction counts for comparison."

exact_answer: "Interferon Signaling"

ideal_answer: |
  Among the four major human inflammatory signaling pathways in Reactome, Interferon Signaling contains the most biochemical reactions with 125 distinct reactions. The Toll Like Receptor 4 Cascade follows with 113 reactions, while Interleukin-1 signaling and TNF signaling have 59 and 58 reactions respectively. The higher complexity of Interferon Signaling reflects the diversity of Type I, Type II, and Type III interferon responses, each involving distinct receptor complexes, JAK-STAT cascades, and downstream transcriptional programs that regulate hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes critical for antiviral immunity.
