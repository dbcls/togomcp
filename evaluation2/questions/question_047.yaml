    category: Ligand
  secondary: []
  relevance: Alkaliphilic bacteria use sodium ions for cytoplasmic pH homeostasis and maintain Na+/H+ antiporter systems to survive extreme alkaline conditions. Sodium gradients drive ATP synthesis and metabolite transport in alkaliphiles.

question:
  text: "List bacterial genera that have been successfully cultured at extremely alkaline pH (≥9.5)."
  context: "Alkaliphilic bacteria thrive in extreme alkaline environments such as soda lakes and industrial waste sites. These organisms maintain cytoplasmic pH near neutral while growing in media with pH 9.5-11, requiring specialized sodium-dependent ion transport systems for survival."

answer:
  correct_answer:
    - Serpentinimonas
    - Demequina
    - Haloactinopolyspora
    - Lipingzhangella
    - Natronoglycomyces
    - Nocardiopsis
    - Streptomyces
    - Alkalimonas
    - Alkalihalobacillus
    - Anaerobacillus
    - Geomicrobium
  explanation: |
    MediaDive contains structured growth condition records linking bacterial strains to culture media with quantitative pH measurements. Querying growth conditions with pH ≥9.5 identifies 11 bacterial genera that have been successfully cultured under extremely alkaline conditions:
    
    **pH 11.0 (Extreme Alkaliphiles):**
    - Serpentinimonas (3 species): S. raichei, S. maccroryi, S. barnesii - isolated from serpentinite environments, grow in specialized minimal medium at pH 11.0 and 30°C
    
    **pH 10.0 (Strong Alkaliphiles):**
    - Nocardiopsis (7 species): Actinobacteria known for antibiotic production, multiple strains grow at pH 10.0
    - Streptomyces (3 species): S. alcalophilus, S. sannurensis, S. sodiiphilus - alkaliphilic actinobacteria
    - Haloactinopolyspora (H. alkaliphila): Halophilic alkaliphilic actinobacterium
    - Natronoglycomyces (N. albus): Alkaliphilic fungal genus (note: question asks for bacteria, but this appears in bacterial media context)
    - Lipingzhangella (L. halophila): Halophilic alkaliphile, grows at pH 10.0 and 37°C
    - Demequina sp.: Actinobacterium growing at pH 10.0
    
    **pH 9.5-9.6 (Moderate Alkaliphiles):**
    - Alkalimonas (A. delamerensis): pH 9.6
    - Alkalihalobacillus sp.: pH 9.5, salt-tolerant alkaliphile
    - Anaerobacillus sp.: pH 9.5, anaerobic alkaliphile
    - Geomicrobium (G. sediminis): pH 9.5
    
    These genera represent diverse taxonomic groups (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes) adapted to alkaline environments through sodium-dependent pH homeostasis mechanisms.

      explanation: |
        Literature contains scattered reports of individual alkaliphilic species but no comprehensive database query-based answer. Papers focus on:
        1. Novel species descriptions (isolated genus reports)
        2. Enzyme characterization (mentions pH tolerance in passing)
        3. Ecological surveys (limited species coverage)
        
        MediaDive uniquely provides:
        - Structured pH measurements from actual growth experiments
        - Comprehensive coverage across 45,685 strains
        - Numerical filtering capability (pH ≥9.5) impossible in text search
        - Quantitative, verifiable cultivation data
  
  structured_data_advantages:
    - "Numerical pH filtering (≥9.5) - impossible in PubMed text search"
    - "Comprehensive coverage from systematic culture collection"
    - "Verified cultivation data from DSMZ standardized protocols"
    - "Hierarchical linking: strain → growth condition → medium → pH measurement"
    - "Enables extraction of unique genera from species-level data"
  
  text_mining_impossibility:
    - "PubMed abstracts rarely mention exact pH values for all species"
    - "No standardized reporting of cultivation conditions in literature"
    - "Scattered reports across thousands of papers (no single comprehensive review)"
    - "Genus-level aggregation requires structured species names in database"
    - "Literature bias toward novel/extreme examples, missing routine alkaliphiles"

verification:
  verifiability_score: 3
  reasoning: "Objectively verifiable by querying MediaDive growth conditions and extracting unique genera from species with pH ≥9.5. Answer is deterministic and reproducible."
  
  rdf_necessity_score: 3
  reasoning: "Absolutely requires MediaDive's structured pH data. PubMed lacks comprehensive genus-level lists and cannot perform numerical pH filtering. Literature provides scattered individual reports, not systematic cultivation database."
  
  scope_score: 3
  reasoning: "Well-defined scope with clear threshold (pH ≥9.5). Results in bounded list of 11 genera from 28 species. Unambiguous answer extractable from structured data."
