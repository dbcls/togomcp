  method: |
    Searched PubMed for "Leigh syndrome NANDO Japan intractable disease notification number"
    and "Leigh syndrome Japan designated intractable disease classification 256000".
  result: |
    Both queries returned 0 results. PubMed literature confirms Leigh syndrome as a rare 
    mitochondrial disease, but provides no information about Japanese government notification 
    numbers (specific NANDO classification) or direct OMIM cross-references from medical 
    genetics RDF databases. The Japanese intractable disease designation (notification number) 
    is registry-specific information not accessible through PubMed searches.
  conclusion: PASS (cannot answer from literature; NANDO designation and MedGen OMIM cross-reference require database-specific RDF queries)

ideal_answer: |
  Leigh syndrome is both classified as a designated intractable disease in the Japanese national rare disease classification system (NANDO: Nanbyodata Disease Ontology) with official notification number 92, and it has an OMIM cross-reference (OMIM:256000) documented in MedGen (CUI C2931891). Leigh syndrome is a rare, progressive mitochondrial encephalomyopathy characterized by subacute necrotizing lesions in the brainstem and basal ganglia, caused by defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare designates it as a notifiable intractable disease eligible for government support programs, reflecting its severity and lack of curative treatment. The NANDO entry (NANDO:2200527) links to MONDO:0009723 for international harmonization, while the MedGen concept links to OMIM:256000, which catalogues the genetic heterogeneity of Leigh syndrome across multiple causal genes. These dual designations in national and international registries illustrate how rare mitochondrial diseases are tracked across regulatory and scientific classification systems.
