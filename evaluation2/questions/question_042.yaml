question_text: "Which category in the NANDO (Nanbyo Data) rare disease ontology contains the most designated intractable diseases?"
choices:
  A: "Metabolic disease"
  B: "Neuromuscular disease"
  C: "Chromosome abnormality"
  D: "Immune system disease"
correct_answer: "B"
explanation: |
  According to NANDO's hierarchical disease classification, Neuromuscular disease 
  (nando:1100001) contains 84 designated intractable diseases, the highest count 
  among all 15 disease categories. This category includes various neurological and 
  muscular disorders, many with neurodegenerative features such as corticobasal 
  degeneration and spinocerebellar degeneration. The next largest categories are 
  Metabolic disease (45), Chromosome abnormality (42), and Immune system disease (27).

      justification: "NANDO is the only database with Japanese rare disease classification and hierarchical category organization"
  supporting: []

why_not_pubmed: |
  PubMed does not contain structured data about NANDO's internal category statistics 
  or disease counts. While PubMed may have articles about individual rare diseases 
  or the Global Burden of Disease, it does not provide the hierarchical disease 
  classification or exact category counts that NANDO's RDF structure enables. 
  
  Search verification:
  - "NANDO ontology intractable diseases category statistics" → 0 results
  - "Japanese rare disease categories neuromuscular" → 1 result (Global Burden of 
    Disease study, not about NANDO statistics)
  
  The answer requires querying NANDO's owl:Class hierarchy with rdfs:subClassOf 
  relationships and counting diseases per category - information structure unique 
  to NANDO's RDF representation.

verification_methodology: |
  **Discovery Phase:**
  1. Listed all 15 disease categories under nando:1000001 (root intractable disease class)
  2. For each category, counted diseases using rdfs:subClassOf relationships
  3. Verified neurodegenerative diseases exist in Neuromuscular category using bif:contains
  
  **Answer Verification:**
  Query: COUNT diseases GROUP BY category
  Results:
  - Neuromuscular disease: 84 diseases (CORRECT ANSWER)
  - Metabolic disease: 45 diseases
  - Chromosome abnormality: 42 diseases
  - Immune system disease: 27 diseases
  
  **PubMed Non-Answerability:** (15 minutes)
  - Searched "NANDO ontology intractable diseases category statistics" → 0 results
  - Searched "Japanese rare disease categories neuromuscular" → 1 irrelevant result
  - Confirmed: PubMed lacks NANDO internal category statistics

verification_score:
  verifiability: 3
  rdf_necessity: 3
  scope: 3
  total: 9
  justification: |
    Verifiability (3/3): Objectively verifiable through SPARQL COUNT query grouped 
    by disease category. Answer is definitively "Neuromuscular disease" with 84 
    diseases vs 45/42/27 for other choices.
    
    RDF Necessity (3/3): Absolutely requires NANDO's RDF structure with owl:Class 
    hierarchy and rdfs:subClassOf relationships. PubMed lacks NANDO's internal 
    category statistics (verified: 0 relevant results). This showcases NANDO's 
    unique hierarchical disease classification as PRIMARY database.
    
    Scope (3/3): Well-bounded to NANDO's 15 disease categories. Question has single 
    correct answer (Neuromuscular disease, 84 diseases) with clear runner-ups. No 
    ambiguity in category definitions or disease counts.
