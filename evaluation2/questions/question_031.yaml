  method: "Searched PubMed with two queries: (1) 'calcium binding proteins human cellular localization distribution' returned 991 papers discussing individual proteins or specific processes, but none providing systematic proteome-wide quantitative comparisons. (2) 'calcium binding proteins plasma membrane versus cytoplasm nuclear quantitative' returned 0 results. Examined top 3 papers from first search - all focused on specific proteins (fetuin-B, tau, syntrophin) rather than systematic distribution analysis."
  result: "No papers provide quantitative comparison of calcium-binding protein distribution across all major cellular compartments. Literature focuses on individual proteins or specific biological processes, not systematic proteome enumeration."
  conclusion: "PASS - Question requires RDF database integration to systematically enumerate all calcium-binding proteins via keyword classification, obtain GO cellular component annotations, and perform quantitative comparison across compartments. Cannot be answered from PubMed alone."

exact_answer:
  - "Plasma membrane"

ideal_answer: |
  Among human calcium-binding proteins, the plasma membrane contains the highest number with 439 proteins, followed by the extracellular region with 217 proteins. This distribution reflects calcium's critical role in membrane-based cellular signaling and cell adhesion. The cytoplasm contains 202 calcium-binding proteins, while the nucleus has 104. Calcium-binding proteins are essential for processes including signal transduction, membrane transport, and cell-cell communication, explaining their enrichment at the plasma membrane where many of these functions occur.
