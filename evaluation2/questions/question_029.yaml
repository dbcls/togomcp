  name: "Molybdenum"
  category: "Ligand"
  selection_rationale: "Selected molybdenum to showcase metal cofactor usage across enzyme classes. Molybdenum is an essential trace element that serves as a cofactor for various enzymes, primarily in redox reactions. This keyword enables comparison of enzyme class distribution for a specific cofactor, demonstrating UniProt's structured keyword classification system."

  method: |
    Tried three search strategies on PubMed:
    1. "molybdenum enzymes EC class distribution" - 0 results
    2. "molybdenum oxidoreductases transferases" - 130 results (mostly about specific enzyme families or cofactor deficiency)
    3. "molybdenum-containing enzymes classification systematic" - 20 results (reviews on specific families)
  
  result: |
    According to PubMed, retrieved articles discuss:
    - Molybdenum cofactor deficiency pathology ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11011-024-01510-9))
    - Metal exposure and enzyme activity ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12011-024-04316-z))
    - Specific molybdenum enzyme families (reviews)
    
    None provide systematic quantitative enumeration of ALL molybdenum-containing proteins grouped by EC class across the entire reviewed protein database. Papers focus on specific enzyme families (e.g., xanthine oxidase family, DMSO reductase family) rather than comprehensive database-wide statistics.
  
  conclusion: "PASS - Requires current comprehensive protein database with keyword classification and EC number annotation. Needs systematic counting across all reviewed proteins, not achievable from literature + training alone."

exact_answer: "EC 1 (Oxidoreductases)"

ideal_answer: |
  Among reviewed proteins containing molybdenum cofactor, EC 1 (Oxidoreductases) has the most representatives with 446 proteins, vastly outnumbering EC 7 (Translocases) with 81 proteins and EC 2 (Transferases) with 22 proteins. EC 3 (Hydrolases) has no molybdenum-containing representatives. This distribution reflects molybdenum's primary biochemical role in electron transfer reactions, particularly in oxidation-reduction processes involving sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon substrates. Notable molybdenum oxidoreductases include sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1), xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.17.3.-), nitrate reductases (EC 1.7.-.-), and formate dehydrogenases (EC 1.17.98.4), which catalyze critical reactions in nitrogen metabolism, purine catabolism, and anaerobic respiration.
