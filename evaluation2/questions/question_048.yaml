    Searched PubMed with two targeted queries:
    (1) "Chlorobiaceae genera BacDive MediaDive culture medium species count taxonomy"
    (2) "Chlorobiaceae green sulfur bacteria culture collection strains diversity NCBI taxonomy species"
  result: |
    Both queries returned 0 results. Published literature covers Chlorobiaceae
    ecology and physiology but does not provide current per-genus counts of
    strains with documented growth conditions in BacDive/MediaDive, nor does
    it cross-reference these with current NCBI Taxonomy species tallies for all
    five genera. The answer requires joining three live databases and cannot
    be recovered from published literature.
  conclusion: PASS (cannot answer from literature - requires current database state)

exact_answer:
  - "Chlorobium: 10 of 13 strains with growth-condition records; 8 NCBI species"
  - "Chlorobaculum: 6 of 6 strains with growth-condition records; 6 NCBI species"
  - "Prosthecochloris: 2 of 3 strains with growth-condition records; 19 NCBI species"
  - "Pelodictyon: 1 of 2 strains with growth-condition records; 4 NCBI species"
  - "Chloroherpeton: 0 of 1 strains with growth-condition records; 1 NCBI species"

  Among the 25 BacDive strains registered across the five genera of the green sulfur bacteria family Chlorobiaceae, 19 are linked to growth-condition records in MediaDive (joined via shared BacDiveID integers). Per-genus breakdowns reveal a pronounced dissociation between culture-collection representation and taxonomic diversity: Chlorobium has the most BacDive strains (13 total, 10 with growth conditions) yet is recognized for only 8 NCBI species, whereas Prosthecochloris is the most species-rich genus in the family (19 NCBI-recognized species, largely owing to genome-based species proposals) but contributes only 3 BacDive strains of which 2 have growth-condition records. Chlorobaculum shows the highest cultivation success rate—all 6 of its BacDive strains are linked to MediaDive growth conditions—which reflects the early isolation and intensive characterization of its model organism Chlorobaculum tepidum alongside 5 additional species. Pelodictyon contributes 2 BacDive strains (1 with growth conditions) and 4 NCBI species, while Chloroherpeton is the most sparsely represented genus: a single BacDive strain with no MediaDive growth-condition record and only 1 NCBI species (monotypic). The per-genus sums are mutually exclusive and verified against family-wide totals: 13+6+3+2+1 = 25 total strains, 10+6+2+1+0 = 19 with growth conditions, and 8+6+19+4+1 = 38 NCBI-recognized species across all five genera.
