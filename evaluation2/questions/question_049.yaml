question:
  text: "List the major metabolic intermediates (chemical compounds) produced in the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway"
  context: |
    The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), also known as the pentose shunt or hexose monophosphate shunt, 
    is a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis. The oxidative phase of the PPP consists of three 
    enzymatic reactions that convert glucose-6-phosphate into ribulose-5-phosphate while generating NADPH. 
    This question asks for the ordered list of chemical intermediates in this pathway phase.
  
  requirements:
    - "Identify all major chemical intermediates in the oxidative phase"
    - "Include both substrate and final product"
    - "List compounds in pathway order"
    - "Provide chemical formulas and ChEBI identifiers"

answer:
  expected_answer: |
    The major metabolic intermediates produced in the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway are:
    1. D-glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) - substrate, formula C6H11O9P, CHEBI:61548
    2. 6-phospho-D-glucono-1,5-lactone (6PGL) - first intermediate, formula C6H9O9P, CHEBI:57955
    3. 6-phospho-D-gluconate (6PG) - second intermediate, formula C6H10O10P, CHEBI:58759
    4. D-ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) - product, formula C5H9O8P, CHEBI:58121
    
    These compounds are produced through three sequential reactions:
    - Reaction 1 (RHEA:15841): G6P → 6PGL (catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase)
    - Reaction 2 (RHEA:12556): 6PGL → 6PG (catalyzed by 6-phosphogluconolactonase)
    - Reaction 3 (RHEA:10116): 6PG → Ru5P + CO2 (catalyzed by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase)
    
    The pathway is classified under GO:0009051 (pentose-phosphate shunt, oxidative branch).

      assessment: |
        Articles mention individual enzymes or intermediates in context of disease or enzyme function 
        but do not provide a comprehensive, ordered list of all intermediates in the pathway.
        
        PMID 41590669: Mentions "glucose-6-phosphate, 6-phosphogluconolactone, 6-phosphogluconate" 
        in passing as metabolites affected by diabetes treatment.
        
        PMID 38848786: Discusses enzyme oxidation effects, mentions "G6P" and "Ribu5-P" as endpoints, 
        but doesn't list all intermediates systematically.
        
        Neither provides the structured, complete list of intermediates with chemical formulas and 
        ChEBI identifiers that RDF databases provide.
  
  conclusion: |
    PubMed articles discuss the pentose phosphate pathway extensively but do not provide 
    structured lists of pathway intermediates with chemical properties. The RDF databases 
    (Rhea + ChEBI) are essential for:
    1. Identifying the complete sequence of reactions and intermediates
    2. Linking reactions to their chemical compounds
    3. Providing chemical formulas and molecular properties
    4. Ensuring accurate compound identification via ChEBI IDs
    
    This information is scattered across pathway databases and cannot be reliably extracted 
    from literature abstracts alone.

  rdf_necessity:
    score: 3
    justification: |
      Cannot be answered from PubMed alone. Requires:
      - Rhea for identifying the three sequential reactions
      - ChEBI for chemical formulas and accurate compound identification
      - Integration between Rhea and ChEBI for compound properties
      Literature mentions intermediates but not in systematic, structured form
  
  verifiability:
    score: 3
    justification: |
      Answer is objectively verifiable through:
      - Rhea reaction equations (RHEA:15841, RHEA:12556, RHEA:10116)
      - ChEBI compound entries (CHEBI:61548, CHEBI:57955, CHEBI:58759, CHEBI:58121)
      - GO pathway classification (GO:0009051)
      - Chemical formulas and molecular masses
      No ambiguity in pathway structure or intermediate identity
  
  scope:
    score: 3
    justification: |
      Well-defined scope:
      - Specific phase: oxidative only (not non-oxidative)
      - Specific pathway: pentose phosphate pathway
      - Clear boundaries: substrate to product (4 compounds total)
      - Objectively bounded: pathway has fixed number of intermediates
      Not open-ended, comparative, or requiring subjective judgment
