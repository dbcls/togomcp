  attempted_answer: "I know that growth factor receptors like EGFR, VEGFR, FGFR, and HGFR are glycoproteins with extracellular domains that undergo N-glycosylation. EGFR is known to be heavily glycosylated, which affects its signaling and receptor turnover. However, I cannot provide: (1) exact number of glycosylation sites per receptor, (2) specific amino acid positions of these sites, (3) comparative quantification across the receptor families, (4) distribution patterns along the extracellular domains, (5) whether one receptor family is consistently more glycosylated than others."
  confidence_level: "low"
  knowledge_sources: "General cell biology knowledge confirms these receptors are glycoproteins, but not the systematic quantitative comparison of site numbers and distributions"
  requires_database: true
  reason: "Requires systematic querying of glycosylation site databases to count sites per receptor, analyze positional distributions, and compare across receptor families. Literature discusses glycosylation functionally but doesn't provide comprehensive comparative site mapping across multiple receptor families."
  decision: "PASS - this question REQUIRES database querying for systematic comparative analysis"

  rationale: |
    Biological Insight (3/3): Reveals systematic differences in glycosylation complexity across growth factor receptor families. Shows that EGFR has exceptional glycosylation density (232 sites) compared to other receptors (VEGFR1: 136, HGFR: 120, FGFR1: 29), which has implications for receptor trafficking, signaling regulation, and therapeutic targeting. The ~8-fold difference between EGFR and FGFR1 suggests family-specific post-translational regulatory mechanisms.
    
    Multi-Database Integration (2/3): Primarily uses Glycosmos glycoprotein and glycosylation site graphs. UniProt links present via rdfs:seeAlso but not queried directly in this analysis. Could be enhanced by integrating PDB structural data or GO functional annotations.
    
    Verifiability (3/3): Summary question with objectively verifiable quantitative data. Site counts per receptor are definitive and reproducible. Distribution patterns can be objectively described through positional analysis. Bounded scope comparing four major receptor families.
    
    RDF Necessity (3/3): Impossible to answer from literature or training knowledge alone. Requires: (1) comprehensive glycosylation site enumeration per receptor, (2) systematic site position extraction from multiple experimental sources, (3) cross-receptor quantitative comparison, (4) integration of glycosylation data from multiple databases (GlyGen, GlyConnect, ACGG GPDB2). Literature provides functional glycosylation studies but lacks systematic comparative site mapping.

  conclusion: "PubMed articles discuss glycosylation of individual receptors (e.g., PMID:32376684 on EOGT glycosylation of EGF repeats) but do NOT provide systematic quantitative comparison of glycosylation site numbers and distribution patterns across EGFR, VEGFR, FGFR, and HGFR families. Papers focus on functional consequences of specific glycosylation events rather than comprehensive site mapping across receptor families. Database integration of glycoproteomics data from GlyGen, GlyConnect, and ACGG GPDB2 is essential for systematic comparative analysis."

exact_answer: |
  EGFR family: 232 sites (19 unique positions, range 56-606)
  VEGFR family (VEGFR1): 136 sites (17 unique positions, range 166-774)
  HGFR family (MET): 120 sites (21 unique positions, range 92-973)
  FGFR family (FGFR1): 29 sites (9 unique positions, range 112-563)

ideal_answer: |
  Human growth factor receptors show striking differences in glycosylation complexity across families, with EGFR displaying the highest glycosylation density. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) contains 232 glycosylation sites concentrated at 19 unique positions spanning amino acids 56-606 in the extracellular domain, showing dense clustering in the region from positions 271-474 (15 sites within ~200 residues). This exceptional glycosylation density likely reflects EGFR's complex regulatory requirements for ligand binding, receptor dimerization, and trafficking.
  
  In comparison, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) has 136 glycosylation sites at 17 unique positions (range 166-774), while hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR/MET) contains 120 sites at 21 positions (range 92-973), both showing more distributed patterns across longer extracellular spans. Notably, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) has the lowest glycosylation with only 29 sites at 9 unique positions (range 112-563), suggesting this receptor family may rely less on N-glycosylation for functional regulation.
  
  The ~8-fold difference in site counts between EGFR (232) and FGFR1 (29) represents distinct post-translational regulatory strategies across receptor families. EGFR's dense glycosylation clustering suggests domain-specific functional requirements, possibly related to its role as a major oncogenic driver where glycosylation modulates receptor internalization, degradation, and signaling duration. The multiple glycan attachments at identical positions (evidenced by total sites exceeding unique positions) indicate heterogeneous glycosylation with different glycan types occupying the same sequons under different cellular conditions.
  
  These glycosylation landscape differences have therapeutic implications: EGFR-targeted therapies must account for extensive glycosylation affecting antibody binding and receptor accessibility, while FGFR inhibitors may face fewer glycan-related complications. The systematic quantification of these patterns, only possible through integrated glycoproteomics databases, reveals family-specific post-translational regulatory mechanisms that complement genetic and structural analyses of receptor tyrosine kinase function.
