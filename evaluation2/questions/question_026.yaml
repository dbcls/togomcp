    PubMed search returned articles on specific topics:
    - PMID:39098675 (DOI: 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.134392): FMN biosynthesis enzyme (riboflavin kinase) in Leishmania donovani - organism-specific study
    - PMID:36162732 (DOI: 10.1016/j.bbagen.2022.130247): Prenylated FMN biosynthesis mechanism - specialized FMN derivative
    - PMID:35313092 (DOI: 10.1111/febs.16445): FMN-binding in Old Yellow Enzymes class III - specific enzyme family
    
    None of these provide:
    - Comprehensive enumeration of FMN-dependent enzyme classes across all organisms
    - Quantitative analysis of FMN's distribution across metabolic pathways
    - Systematic categorization of FMN's biochemical roles (electron transfer, oxygenation, etc.)
    - Current database cross-references for FMN-binding proteins
    - Integration of chemical structure, reactions, proteins, functions, and pathways
    
    Literature provides individual examples and mechanistic details but lacks:
    - Systematic enumeration (how many FMN-binding proteins exist?)
    - Quantitative distribution (how many reactions use FMN in different pathway types?)
    - Cross-database integration (linking FMN chemical properties → reactions → proteins → pathways)
  conclusion: "PASS - Cannot answer from literature alone. Requires systematic RDF database integration."

  FMN serves as a versatile redox cofactor in cellular metabolism with 8,435 characterized FMN-binding proteins and 60 curated biochemical reactions. Its major roles include: (1) Electron transfer - FMN reductases (EC 1.5.1.x) mediate electron transfer between NAD(P)H and cellular acceptors, functioning as obligate two-electron carriers in flavoprotein systems. (2) Oxygenation reactions - FMN-dependent monooxygenases (EC 1.14.14.x) catalyze substrate hydroxylation and heteroatom oxidation in xenobiotic metabolism and biosynthetic pathways. (3) Cofactor biosynthesis - Riboflavin kinase (EC 2.7.1.26) phosphorylates riboflavin to generate FMN, which FAD synthase (EC 2.7.7.2) then adenylylates to produce FAD, establishing FMN as the central intermediate in flavin cofactor metabolism. (4) Covalent protein modification - Some enzymes utilize FMN-protein lyases (EC 2.7.1.180) to attach FMN covalently to threonine residues, creating stable flavoenzyme active sites. FMN's contribution to metabolism spans oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid catabolism, lipid oxidation, and detoxification pathways, with its reduced form (FMNH2) enabling single-electron transfer to molecular oxygen while the oxidized form (FMN) accepts electrons from reduced substrates.
