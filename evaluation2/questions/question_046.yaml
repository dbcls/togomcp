question:
  text: "Does any Asian country show more than 80% carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates according to AMRPortal surveillance data?"
  
answer:
  value: "YES"
  explanation: |
    According to AMRPortal surveillance data, Vietnam shows 90.2% carbapenem (meropenem) resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, with 322 resistant isolates out of 357 total isolates tested. This exceeds the 80% threshold specified in the question.
    
    Pakistan also shows relatively high resistance at 32.6% (70/215 isolates), and Nepal at 20.8% (22/106 isolates), but only Vietnam exceeds 80%.

  time_spent_minutes: 15
  answerability: "NOT_ANSWERABLE"
  reasoning: |
    PubMed literature provides hospital-level or regional studies but lacks the systematic, 
    country-aggregated surveillance data needed to answer this question. The papers found 
    discuss rising resistance rates but don't provide the specific country-level percentages 
    required. AMRPortal's structured geographic hierarchy and phenotypic measurements enable 
    the precise country-level percentage calculation (Vietnam: 90.2%) that cannot be easily 
    extracted from published literature.

  total_score: 9
  max_score: 9

rationale:
  why_this_question: |
    This question showcases AMRPortal's PRIMARY strength: structured geographic antimicrobial 
    resistance surveillance. It demonstrates capabilities that published literature cannot easily 
    provide:
    
    1. Country-level aggregation of resistance data
    2. Precise percentage calculations from phenotypic measurements
    3. Geographic hierarchy (Asia → country) enabling regional analysis
    4. Systematic surveillance data vs. scattered hospital reports
    
    The answer (Vietnam: 90.2% resistance) reveals a critical public health finding that 
    requires structured RDF data to discover.
  
  why_not_pubmed: |
    PubMed literature provides valuable but scattered information:
    - Hospital-specific studies (not country-level)
    - Regional analyses (not systematic national surveillance)
    - Qualitative descriptions ("high", "rising") rather than precise percentages
    - Fragmented data across multiple publications
    
    To answer this question from literature alone, one would need to:
    1. Find all relevant papers for each Asian country
    2. Extract resistance data from different methodologies
    3. Aggregate across studies (risking bias)
    4. Compare to the 80% threshold
    
    AMRPortal provides this answer in a single structured query.
  
  database_integration: |
    This question uses AMRPortal as a STANDALONE PRIMARY database, demonstrating its core 
    capability without requiring integration. Future questions could integrate:
    - Taxonomy (for species-level analysis)
    - ChEMBL (for carbapenem compound properties)
    - MeSH (for literature linking)
    
    But for this surveillance question, AMRPortal alone is sufficient and appropriate.
