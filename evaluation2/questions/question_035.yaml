  method: "Web searched for 'how many PubMed articles mention Parkinson disease SNCA gene' to see if this count is readily available. Found numerous review articles and studies about SNCA variants in PD (mentioning '57 studies', '58 studies', '89 articles', '231 cases'), but none provided the specific total count of all articles co-mentioning both Parkinson disease and SNCA."
  result: "Review articles provide qualitative information about SNCA's role in PD but do not enumerate the total literature corpus where both entities are mentioned. The closest quantitative information was about specific variant studies (89-231 articles), not general co-mentions across all literature."
  conclusion: "PASS - Cannot obtain the precise co-mention count (31,319 articles) from PubMed searches or literature reviews. Requires systematic entity annotation and cross-database linking that only PubTator provides."

  According to PubTator Central, 31,319 PubMed articles mention both Parkinson disease and the SNCA gene. This quantifies the extensive literature linking alpha-synuclein (encoded by SNCA) to Parkinson disease pathogenesis. SNCA was the first pathogenic gene identified for familial Parkinson disease, and its protein product forms the main component of Lewy bodies, a hallmark of the disease. The large co-mention count reflects SNCA's central role in PD research spanning genetics, pathology, and therapeutic development.
