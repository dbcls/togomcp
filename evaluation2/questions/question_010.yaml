  biological_insight_explanation: "Reveals the chemical diversity of FDA-approved drugs through ontological classification. While technically focused, it provides insight into the breadth of chemical space covered by approved therapeutics."
  multi_database: 1
  multi_database_explanation: "Single database (PubChem) question. Strategic choice to feature the most underrepresented database (0% usage). Maintains overall dataset at 60% multi-DB ratio (6/10)."
  verifiability: 3
  verifiability_explanation: "Exact count of 4,784 distinct ChEBI classes. Highly reproducible through SPARQL query with controlled vocabularies (FDA approval status + ChEBI IRI namespace)."
  rdf_necessity: 3
  rdf_necessity_explanation: "Absolutely requires RDF/SPARQL. Search/API tools cannot: (1) filter by FDA approval status (no API parameter), (2) extract ChEBI ontology class IRIs (structured RDF typing), (3) count distinct classes (requires aggregation with namespace filtering). Manually collecting this data would require inspecting thousands of compounds individually."

pubmed_test:
  time_spent: "15 minutes"
  method: "Tested two PubMed queries: (1) 'FDA approved drugs ChEBI chemical classification count' and (2) 'PubChem FDA approved chemical ontology ChEBI diversity'. Both returned 0 results."
  result: "No publications found addressing this specific computational question about ChEBI class diversity in FDA-approved PubChem compounds."
  conclusion: "PASS (cannot answer) - This is a database-specific quantitative analysis question not addressed in biomedical literature."

exact_answer:
  - "4784"

ideal_answer: |
  Among FDA-approved drugs catalogued in PubChem, there are 4,784 distinct ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) chemical entity classes represented. This high diversity reflects the broad chemical space covered by approved therapeutics, where each ChEBI class represents a specific chemical structure or classification within the ontology's hierarchical framework. The one-to-one mapping between compounds and classes suggests that PubChem's ChEBI annotations are highly specific, with each approved drug receiving its own detailed chemical classification within the ChEBI ontology hierarchy. This granular classification enables precise chemical taxonomy for drug discovery and chemoinformatics applications.
