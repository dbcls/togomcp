question:
  text: "What is the highest atomic resolution (smallest ls_d_res_high value in Ångströms) achieved for any macromolecular structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank?"
  
expected_answer:
  answer: "0.48 Ångströms (Å)"
  details: |
    The highest atomic resolution achieved in PDB is 0.48 Å, which is shared by two structures:
    - 5D8V: Ultra-high resolution structure of high-potential iron-sulfur protein
    - 3NIR: Crystal structure of small protein crambin at 0.48 A resolution
    
    Both structures were determined using X-ray crystallography and represent exceptional 
    examples of ultra-high resolution structural biology. At this resolution, individual 
    atoms and their valence electron density can be directly observed.

databases_required:
  - name: "PDB"
    role: "PRIMARY - resolution data source"
    access_method: "togomcp_local:run_sparql"
    justification: "PDB contains the ls_d_res_high (high-resolution limit) values for all deposited structures. This is the only comprehensive source for comparing resolution across all PDB entries."

rdf_query_approach:
  discovery_phase:
    - step: 1
      action: "Read PDB MIE file"
      tool: "togomcp_local:get_MIE_file"
      parameters:
        dbname: "pdb"
      rationale: "Understand PDB schema, identify resolution property, and confirm data structure"
    
  verification_phase:
    - step: 2
      action: "Query highest resolution structures"
      tool: "togomcp_local:run_sparql"
      parameters:
        dbname: "pdb"

          PREFIX pdbx: <http://rdf.wwpdb.org/schema/pdbx-v50.owl#>
          PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
          
          SELECT ?entry_id ?resolution ?title

            ?entry a pdbx:datablock .

          }
          ORDER BY xsd:decimal(?resolution)
          LIMIT 20
      rationale: "Retrieve all sub-Ångström structures and sort by resolution to find the highest (lowest numeric value)"
      result_summary: "Found two structures at 0.48 Å: 5D8V (HiPIP) and 3NIR (crambin)"

alternative_approaches:
  web_search:
    feasible: false
    explanation: |
      Web search would not provide a definitive, verifiable answer because:
      1. General articles may discuss ultra-high resolution but not comprehensively list all structures
      2. Resolution records may be outdated in published literature
      3. No systematic comparison across all PDB entries
      4. Results would be anecdotal rather than database-verified

  pubmed_search:
    attempts:
      - query: "highest resolution protein structure atomic resolution X-ray crystallography sub-angstrom"
        results: 0
      - query: "0.48 angstrom resolution protein crystal structure PDB"
        results: 0
    feasible: false
    explanation: |
      PubMed search yielded zero results because:
      1. Publications rarely report on "highest resolution" as a research topic
      2. Individual structure papers don't compare across the entire PDB
      3. Resolution achievements are technical details, not primary research findings
      4. Comprehensive resolution statistics require database queries, not literature review

  claude_training:
    feasible: false
    explanation: |
      This requires live database querying because:
      1. PDB is continuously updated with new structures
      2. Resolution records can be improved through re-refinement
      3. Training data cutoff means current highest resolution is unknown
      4. Specific numeric comparison across 245K+ entries needs database access

verification:
  objectively_verifiable: true

  bounded_scope: true
  scope_explanation: "Limited to structures deposited in PDB with reported resolution values"
  requires_rdf: true
  rdf_necessity_explanation: |
    Absolutely requires RDF database access because:
    1. Must query 245,833 structures systematically
    2. Requires numeric comparison across entire dataset
    3. Needs structured resolution data (pdbx:refine.ls_d_res_high)
    4. Cannot be answered from literature or general knowledge
    5. Requires sorting and filtering capabilities only available through SPARQL

reasoning:
  verifiability_justification: |
    Score: 3/3 - Perfectly verifiable
    - Resolution is a quantitative, objective measurement
    - Stored as structured data in PDB (pdbx:refine.ls_d_res_high)
    - Numeric comparison yields definitive answer
    - Multiple independent observers would get identical results
  
  rdf_necessity_justification: |
    Score: 3/3 - Absolutely requires RDF
    - PubMed search: 0 results
    - Requires querying 245K+ structures with numeric filtering
    - Must access structured property data across entire database
    - SPARQL sorting and filtering essential for finding minimum value
    - No other method can comprehensively answer this question
  
  scope_justification: |
    Score: 3/3 - Perfectly bounded
    - Clear numeric comparison (find minimum ls_d_res_high)
    - Limited to PDB entries only
    - Single well-defined property
    - No ambiguity in question interpretation
    - Deterministic answer
