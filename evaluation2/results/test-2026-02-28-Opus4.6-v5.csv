The exact count depends on the database snapshot; the RDF portal query returned 20 current records at time of query, while the live NCBI ClinVar release contains ≥66 such variants. Variants include missense substitutions affecting functionally critical residues in the alpha-crystallin domain (e.g., c.379C>T p.Arg127Trp, c.404C>T p.Ser135Phe, c.406C>T p.Arg136Trp, c.418C>G p.Arg140Gly, c.545C>T p.Pro182Leu), as well as frameshift and nonsense variants (e.g., c.109dup p.Arg37fs (Likely pathogenic), c.532G>T p.Glu178Ter (Likely pathogenic)). Several large deletions at the HSPB1 locus on chromosome 7q11.23 also appear in the dataset. CMT2F is an autosomal dominant axonal peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy characterised by distal muscle weakness, sensory loss, and reduced tendon reflexes with onset ranging from the first to sixth decade.
",True,6.96,"Yes, the HSPB1 gene (Heat Shock Protein Family B Member 1) has pathogenic variants documented in ClinVar associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. HSPB1 is causally linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F (CMT2F) and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 2B (dHMN2B), both of which are inherited peripheral neuropathies. Pathogenic variants in HSPB1 typically follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and affect the small heat shock protein's function in cellular stress response and cytoskeletal maintenance. The mutations documented in ClinVar include missense variants that cluster in functionally important domains of the protein, particularly affecting the alpha-crystallin domain and flanking regions. These variants disrupt the protein's chaperone activity and its ability to maintain proper axonal function in peripheral nerves, leading to progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy characteristic of CMT2F.

question_004,summary,Summarize the distribution of melatonin biosynthesis enzymes across species and characterize their molecular functions and the chemical intermediates involved.,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are distributed across 16 species spanning three kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi), with 33 reviewed proteins in total. Mammals account for 14 proteins across 9 taxa, including two human paralogs (AANAT and ASMT), with coverage extending to mouse, rat, cattle, sheep, macaque, hamster, chimpanzee, and Mus musculus molossinus. Plants contribute 14 proteins from 4 taxa: Arabidopsis thaliana (4 proteins), Oryza sativa subsp. japonica (7 proteins, the most of any single organism), Oryza sativa subsp. indica (1 protein), and Zea mays (2 proteins). Additional representatives include two bird proteins in Gallus gallus, two insect proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, and one fungal protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The pathway proceeds through two enzymatic steps acting on distinct chemical intermediates: first, aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT, GO:0004059, a subclass of N-acetyltransferase activity) converts serotonin (CHEBI:28790, C10H12N2O) to N-acetylserotonin (CHEBI:17697, C12H14N2O2); then acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT, GO:0017096, a subclass of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity) converts N-acetylserotonin to melatonin (CHEBI:16796, C13H16N2O2). Exactly 17 proteins are annotated with AANAT activity and 16 with ASMT activity, with no overlap. This enzymatic conservation across evolutionarily distant taxa — from yeast to plants to mammals — indicates an ancient origin of the two-step melatonin biosynthesis mechanism, with the pathway starting from tryptophan (CHEBI:27897, C11H12N2O2) via serotonin as the upstream precursor.
",True,10.22,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are widely distributed across the evolutionary tree, from bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes through plants to vertebrates, though the enzymatic pathways show significant variation. In vertebrates, melatonin synthesis occurs primarily in the pineal gland through a conserved four-step pathway beginning with tryptophan, which is converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase, then to serotonin by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. The rate-limiting enzyme arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) acetylates serotonin to N-acetylserotonin using acetyl-CoA as a cofactor, and finally hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT, also called ASMT) methylates N-acetylserotonin to melatonin using S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor. In non-vertebrate species, alternative pathways exist: plants synthesize melatonin through similar intermediates but utilize different enzymes including tryptophan decarboxylase, tryptamine 5-hydroxylase, serotonin N-acetyltransferase, and N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase, with evidence for additional routes bypassing serotonin. Some invertebrates possess AANAT-like enzymes but lack clear HIOMT orthologs, suggesting convergent evolution or alternative methylation mechanisms. The molecular function of AANAT involves transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the primary amine of serotonin, while HIOMT/ASMT catalyzes O-methylation at the 5-hydroxy position. Bacterial and protist melatonin synthesis pathways remain less characterized but appear to involve enzymatically distinct mechanisms, indicating that melatonin biosynthesis evolved independently multiple times across different lineages.",333,447,0.007704,True,175.92,"Based on the comprehensive database queries, I can now provide a complete synthesis of melatonin biosynthesis enzyme distribution, molecular functions, and chemical intermediates.

Melatonin biosynthesis occurs widely across kingdoms through a conserved two-step enzymatic pathway involving serotonin N-acetyltransferase (AANAT, EC 2.3.1.87) and acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT, EC 2.1.1.4). These enzymes are distributed across vertebrates including mammals (humans, primates, rodents, ungulates), birds (chicken), and lower vertebrates, as well as invertebrates (Drosophila melanogaster), plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa), and fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The first enzyme, serotonin N-acetyltransferase, catalyzes the acetylation of serotonin using acetyl-CoA as cofactor to produce N-acetylserotonin, releasing coenzyme A and a proton (Rhea:25217). The second enzyme, acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase, performs the final step by transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to N-acetylserotonin, yielding melatonin plus S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and a proton (Rhea:15573). The complete biosynthetic pathway begins with the essential amino acid L-tryptophan, which undergoes hydroxylation to 5-hydroxytryptophan and subsequent decarboxylation to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), establishing the indoleamine substrate pool. In plants, particularly rice and Arabidopsis, multiple ASMT and AANAT isoforms exist with chloroplastic localization, indicating evolutionary adaptation for organellar melatonin synthesis with potential roles in photosynthetic regulation and stress responses. An alternative minor pathway exists in some organisms where 5-methoxytryptamine can be directly acetylated to melatonin via acetyl-CoA (Rhea:66144), and melatonin can be catabolized through hydrolytic deacetylation back to 5-methoxytryptamine (Rhea:67208) or hydroxylation to 2-hydroxymelatonin via 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxidation (Rhea:62512), representing degradative and regulatory mechanisms.",31,2367,0.39763495,0.405339,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__pubdictionaries__find_ids",3,3,5,4,15,Provides general knowledge about melatonin biosynthesis across species but includes inaccurate bacterial mention and lacks database-specific protein counts from the ideal.,3,4,4,3,14,"Identifies key enzymes (AANAT, ASMT) and cross-kingdom distribution.

question_005,choice,"Among the following kinase groups — AGC, CAMK, CMGC, and TK — which has the greatest number of human protein targets with experimentally determined X-ray crystal structures deposited in the PDB?

Choose one of the following options:
  - AGC
  - CAMK
  - CMGC
  - TK","TK (tyrosine kinases) has the greatest number of human protein targets with
PDB X-ray crystal structures, with 2,280 structures across 80 ChEMBL-classified
human targets. CMGC ranks second (1,539 structures, 58 targets), followed by
CAMK (734 structures, 65 targets) and AGC (422 structures, 59 targets).

TK dominates structural coverage because tyrosine kinases are the primary targets
in cancer drug discovery. The EGFR family alone (EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4) accounts
for hundreds of entries; BCR-ABL1 (P00519) has over 200 structures due to
imatinib-resistance studies; VEGFR2/KDR (P35968), ALK (Q9UM73), c-MET (P08581),
RET (P07949), FGFR1-4, and the SRC family kinases each contribute dozens to
hundreds of structures. The pharmaceutical industry's intense focus on TK
inhibitors for oncology has driven an outsized crystallographic effort relative
to the number of targets.

CMGC ranks second because it includes intensively studied targets: CDK2 (P24941)
alone has over 400 PDB structures from fragment-based and structure-based drug
design campaigns; CDK4/6 (cyclin-dependent kinases), CDK8, CDK9, MAPK1/ERK2
(P28482), MAPK14/p38α (Q16539), GSK3B (P49841), and DYRK1A (Q13627) are all
major drug targets with large structural datasets.

CAMK ranks third despite having the most targets (65) among the four groups,
because many CAMK members (e.g., CaM kinases, DAPK, CHK1, CHK2) are less
pharmacologically tractable or have been structurally solved fewer times.

AGC ranks last (422 structures) despite its prominent members (AKT1/2/3, PKCα,
PKA, RSK1-4, S6K1) because several AGC kinases proved challenging for structural
biology due to flexibility or membrane association, and the group has fewer
members overall.

A note on cross-group overlap: 70 PDB structures (1.4%) contain proteins with
dual classification in ChEMBL (6 proteins annotated as both AGC and CAMK). These
structures are counted in both groups' totals. This overlap does not affect the
answer — TK leads CMGC by 741 structures, far exceeding the 70-structure overlap.
",True,8.32,"The correct answer is **CMGC**.

CDK2 alone has dozens of structures deposited, and the various MAPK family members (ERK1/2, p38, JNK) collectively contribute numerous structures. While the TK (tyrosine kinase) group is also well-represented in the PDB due to intense pharmaceutical interest, and AGC kinases (including PKA, PKC, AKT) have many structures, the CMGC group's combination of multiple well-studied subfamilies with extensive structural characterization gives it the highest total count of deposited crystal structures among these four kinase groups.",256,261,0.004683,True,357.8,"Interesting - the expanded search gave me 1180, which is actually less than my first TK search (1512).

Across all three categories, Firmicutes is the dominant phylum, contributing 2,096 anaerobes, 1,686 facultative anaerobes, and 94 obligate anaerobes; Proteobacteria ranks second among anaerobes (810) and ties with Firmicutes among facultative anaerobes (1,683); Actinobacteria accounts for 676 anaerobes and 490 facultative anaerobes, while Bacteroidetes contributes 351 anaerobes and 111 facultative anaerobes. At the order level, Lactobacillales leads with 1,557 strains, followed by Clostridiales (861), Enterobacterales (741), Actinomycetales (557), and Eubacteriales (409). Temperature data from BacDive's structured CultureTemperature records show that general anaerobes (4,707 strains with temperature data) grow across an extraordinarily broad range of −2 to 103°C with an average optimum near 36.4°C, facultative anaerobes (4,224 strains) span 0–90°C with a cooler mean of 26.8°C reflecting their greater ecological breadth, and obligate anaerobes (216 strains) average 36.9°C with a range of −1.8 to 112°C indicating adaptation to extreme environments. Cross-database integration with MediaDive identifies 4,984 anaerobic strains with linked medium records; the most commonly used media are Columbia Blood Medium (744 strains), EG Medium (402), Trypticase Soy Yeast Extract Medium (357), PYG Medium modified (330), and BL Agar (249), reflecting the nutritionally rich, reduced-oxygen formulations required by these organisms.

These organisms exhibit varying oxygen tolerance characteristics: obligate anaerobes are killed by atmospheric oxygen levels and include genera like Clostridium and Bacteroides; aerotolerant anaerobes can survive oxygen exposure but do not use it for growth, exemplified by some Lactobacillus species; and facultative anaerobes can grow with or without oxygen, such as Escherichia coli and many Streptococcus species. Typical culture conditions require strict anaerobic techniques including pre-reduced media with reducing agents like cysteine, thioglycolate, or dithiothreitol, oxygen-free atmospheres generated through gas mixtures (typically 80-90% nitrogen, 5-10% hydrogen, 5-10% carbon dioxide), anaerobic chambers or jars with catalysts to remove residual oxygen, and redox indicators such as resazurin to monitor anaerobiosis. Most anaerobes grow optimally at 35-37°C with pH ranges of 6.5-7.5, though extremophiles exist with different requirements.

question_009,list,Which human enzymes with catalytic roles in the leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway are documented drug targets in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records?,"Five of the eight human enzymes with catalytic roles in the Reactome leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway have mechanism-of-action records in ChEMBL. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, CHEMBL215) has the most ChEMBL mechanism records of any pathway enzyme, with eight drugs documented as inhibitors, including zileuton (phase 4), the only FDA-approved drug specifically indicated for asthma that acts by reversibly inhibiting this rate-limiting step in leukotriene synthesis, as well as five other phase-4 anti-inflammatory agents (mesalamine, sulfasalazine, balsalazide disodium, olsalazine sodium, meclofenamate sodium) and two phase-2 clinical candidates (PF-4191834, atreleuton). The 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP/FLAP, CHEMBL4550) is the most clinically active target, with three distinct phase-3 clinical inhibitors — fiboflapon, fiboflapon sodium, and veliflapon — all documented as INHIBITOR mechanisms. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H, CHEMBL4618), which converts LTA4 to the potent chemoattractant LTB4, is targeted by acebilustat at phase 2. The multidrug resistance-associated protein ABCC1/MRP1 (CHEMBL3004), which exports LTC4 across the cell membrane as part of the pathway, is targeted by the phase-2 multidrug resistance modulator biricodar. MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2, CHEMBL2208), which activates ALOX5 via phosphorylation, is targeted at phase 1 by AT-13148, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor. Three pathway enzymes — arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1), and leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) — lack ChEMBL mechanism records despite participating in the pathway, reflecting their lower prioritisation as drug targets in clinical development programmes.
",True,9.18,"In the leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway, several human enzymes with catalytic roles are documented as drug targets in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, 5-LO) is a primary drug target that catalyzes the first committed step in leukotriene biosynthesis, converting arachidonic acid to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) and subsequently to leukotriene A4 (LTA4); it is targeted by drugs such as zileuton, a direct 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) conjugates LTA4 with glutathione to form LTC4, representing another enzymatic step, though it has more limited representation as a drug target with documented mechanisms. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) converts LTA4 to leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and is documented in ChEMBL as a target with specific inhibitors characterized by their mechanism of action. Additionally, arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) catalyzes the formation of 15-HPETE, which serves as a precursor for eoxin biosynthesis, and appears in ChEMBL with associated mechanism-of-action data. 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP, ALOX5AP), while not directly catalytic, is an essential regulatory protein for 5-LO activity and is a well-documented drug target in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records for inhibitors like MK-591 and related compounds.",344,419,0.007317,True,129.27,"Confirmed - ALOX15 (CHEMBL2903) has no mechanism-of-action records.

1. **ALOX5** (Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase / Polyunsaturated fatty acid 5-lipoxygenase) - 8 mechanism records
2. **LTA4H** (Leukotriene A-4 hydrolase) - 1 mechanism record

question_010,choice,"Which parent disease category of systemic lupus erythematosus has the most diseases with confirmed MeSH TopicalDescriptor mappings?

Choose one of the following options:
  - immune system disorder
  - autoimmune disease
  - connective tissue disorder
  - rheumatic disorder","Immune system disorder (MONDO:0005046) has the most diseases with confirmed MeSH TopicalDescriptor mappings among the four parent categories of systemic lupus erythematosus, with 248 confirmed MeSH TopicalDescriptors across its disease subclasses. This substantially exceeds connective tissue disorder (134 TopicalDescriptors), autoimmune disease (61 TopicalDescriptors), and rheumatic disorder (39 TopicalDescriptors). The counts reflect confirmed joins with the MeSH RDF graph restricted to meshv:TopicalDescriptor entries (i.e., canonical MeSH headings used for indexing); MONDO cross-references to MeSH supplementary concept records (MESH:C...) are excluded. The four categories are not mutually exclusive: immune system disorder is the broadest and contains the other three as subcategories, so their diseases are counted within it as well — the sum across categories (482) exceeds the 346 unique diseases with TopicalDescriptor mappings due to this intentional overlap in the ontology hierarchy. The higher absolute count for immune system disorder reflects its greater scope rather than a higher per-disease mapping rate, since autoimmune disease and rheumatic disorder actually have proportionally good coverage relative to their size.
",True,6.26,"The correct answer is **autoimmune disease**.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has multiple parent disease categories in the MeSH hierarchy, including autoimmune disease, connective tissue disorder, immune system disorder, and rheumatic disorder. Among these, autoimmune disease represents the most specific and directly relevant classification for SLE and encompasses the largest number of related conditions with confirmed MeSH TopicalDescriptor mappings. The autoimmune disease category includes numerous well-defined entities such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, and various organ-specific autoimmune conditions, all of which have established MeSH descriptors. While immune system disorder is broader and technically includes more diseases overall, autoimmune disease as a more focused subcategory contains the highest density of diseases with confirmed MeSH mappings that share pathogenic mechanisms with SLE. Connective tissue disorder and rheumatic disorder, though relevant to SLE, represent narrower classifications with fewer total mapped diseases compared to the comprehensive autoimmune disease category.",242,242,0.004356,True,70.83,"Perfect!

question_011,factoid,How many distinct PubChem compounds participate in chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis reactions documented in Rhea?,"Chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis involves the enzymatic conversion of tetrapyrrole precursors into photosynthetically active pigments. The Rhea database documents these biochemical reactions by linking them to chemical entities in ChEBI. Querying Rhea reactions whose equation text mentions ""chlorophyll"" or ""bacteriochlorophyll"" and extracting their associated ChEBI compound identifiers (via the rh:chebi property) yields 64 unique ChEBI chemical entities involved in these pathways. These ChEBI classes serve as type annotations for PubChem compound entries (via rdf:type assertions), enabling cross-database integration. Filtering for PubChem compounds (those with URIs starting with ""http://rdf.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/compound/"") that are typed by any of these 64 ChEBI classes yields 24 distinct compounds. These include central pathway intermediates such as protoporphyrinogen IX, Mg-protoporphyrin IX, and various chlorophyllide derivatives, as well as cofactors like NADPH, ATP, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The substantially smaller number of PubChem entries relative to ChEBI classes reflects the fact that many highly specific tetrapyrrole intermediates and bacteriochlorophyll precursors, though well-defined in ChEBI, do not yet have curated entries in PubChem.
",True,6.95,"I do not have access to real-time databases like Rhea or PubChem, so I cannot provide the specific number of distinct PubChem compounds that participate in chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis reactions currently documented in the Rhea database.

Decorin is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan bearing glycosylation at six distinct amino acid positions: 34, 115, 211, 255, 262, and 303. The database records 286 total glycosylation site entries for decorin, reflecting the multiple glycan structures (glycoforms) annotated at individual positions — position 211 alone carries 132 distinct glycoform entries and position 262 carries 121, indicating extensive N-glycan microheterogeneity at these asparagine residues. The site at position 34 corresponds to the canonical glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin/dermatan sulfate) attachment serine characteristic of the proteoglycan core protein. This rich glycosylation complexity is consistent with decorin's biological roles in extracellular matrix organization, collagen fibrillogenesis, and TGF-β sequestration, where the glycan chains modulate protein–protein interactions and tissue hydration.
",True,7.03,"I cannot provide definitive information about whether human decorin (UniProt:P07585) has documented glycosylation sites specifically in the GlyCosmos database, as I do not have direct access to query that database or knowledge of its current contents. However, human decorin is well-established as a proteoglycan that undergoes extensive glycosylation. The protein contains a single glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment site near its N-terminus, specifically at serine-34, where a chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate chain is attached. Additionally, decorin possesses multiple N-glycosylation sites within its leucine-rich repeat domain. The protein's core protein has a molecular weight of approximately 40 kDa, but the fully glycosylated form ranges from 90-140 kDa due to these post-translational modifications. Given decorin's importance as a major component of the extracellular matrix and its well-characterized glycosylation pattern, it would be reasonable to expect that such sites are documented in comprehensive glycosylation databases like GlyCosmos, but I cannot confirm the specific database entries without direct access to that resource.",332,265,0.004971,True,49.61,"Excellent!

CEP290 encodes a centrosomal protein localised to primary cilia and is mutated across numerous ciliopathy subtypes including Joubert syndrome types 5 and 14, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and nephronophthisis. RPGRIP1L (Joubert syndrome 7) and CC2D2A (Joubert syndrome 9) encode transition zone components critical for ciliary gate integrity, while AHI1 (jouberin, Joubert syndrome 3) mediates cerebellar and cortical development. TMEM67 (meckelin, Joubert syndrome 6) is a receptor-like transmembrane protein required for primary cilium formation. The high allelic burden in these genes reflects their role as major disease loci across multiple Joubert syndrome subtypes, the diagnostic importance of comprehensive multi-subtype variant cataloguing, and the evolutionary conservation of ciliary transition zone architecture.

question_015,summary,"Characterize the reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 across three dimensions: their GO-annotated functional module assignments (capsid, baseplate, and tail components); any enzymatic activities encoded among these otherwise structural late proteins; and their experimental structural coverage, including the relative proportions of cryo-electron microscopy versus X-ray crystallography depositions.","The 25 reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4, all annotated with KW-0426, collectively encode the phage's iconic contractile tail-injection nanomachine and partition into four major GO-defined structural modules: the capsid (2 proteins: CAPSH/major capsid protein, CAPSP/capsid vertex), the baseplate (11 proteins: the ten wedge and hub assembly proteins gp7, gp10, gp25, gp27, gp48, gp53, gp54, gp26, gp28, gp51, plus the pre-baseplate central spike gp5), the tail tube and completion system (4 proteins: gp19 tube, tail tube terminator, tape-measure protein, gp15 tail completion protein), and the tail fibers (5 proteins: short fiber gp12, three long-fiber subunits gp35/gp36/gp37, and the long-fiber proximal subunit), with the structural collar protein fibritin (WAC) and two DNA helicase isoforms (uvsW and uvsW1) completing the set. Enzymatically, two late proteins break the ""purely structural"" expectation: gp5 (NEEDL_BPT4) bears lysozyme activity (GO:0003796) that hydrolyzes peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall to puncture the host envelope during injection, while the uvsW DNA helicases (GO:0043138, 3'-5' DNA helicase activity) drive late-phase recombination and repair, a function unusual for proteins expressed after DNA replication has begun. Of the 25 proteins, 17 (68%) are structurally characterized in PDB via at least one entry, yielding 149 distinct structures (103 by cryo-electron microscopy, 44 by X-ray crystallography, 2 by solution NMR); because T4 assemblies are large multi-subunit complexes—the baseplate alone contains 11 late proteins—the same PDB entry frequently references multiple T4 proteins, producing 182 total protein-to-entry attributions for 149 distinct structures (33 attribution counts arise from co-occurrence in assemblies). The striking dominance of cryo-EM (69% of entries) reflects the field's shift toward studying intact viral assemblies: fibritin alone accounts for 104 of these entries due to its adoption as an engineering scaffold, while the gp5 spike (18 entries) and major capsid protein (9 entries) follow; the eight structurally uncharacterized proteins—most notably the three baseplate hub proteins gp26, gp28, and gp51, the two long tail-fiber subunits gp35 and gp36, and the two uvsW helicase isoforms—represent current frontiers in T4 structural biology.
",True,11.94,"The late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 comprise approximately 40-50 reviewed structural components that assemble into three primary functional modules: the icosahedral capsid (including major capsid protein gp23, vertex protein gp24, and portal protein gp20), the elongated tail tube and sheath (gp19 tail tube protein and gp18 tail sheath protein), and the elaborate baseplate complex (containing at least 15 distinct proteins including gp5, gp6, gp7, gp8, gp9, gp10, gp11, gp12, gp25, gp26, gp27, gp48, gp53, and the tail fibers gp34 and gp37). Despite their predominantly structural roles, several late proteins possess enzymatic activities: gp5 carries lysozyme activity for cell wall degradation during infection, gp16 functions as a terminase with ATPase and endonuclease activities for DNA packaging, and the long tail fibers contain receptor-binding domains with endorhamnosidase activity. The structural characterization of T4 late proteins has been extensive, with approximately 60-70% of these proteins having experimentally determined structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. X-ray crystallography has historically provided the majority of atomic-resolution structures for individual protein domains and smaller oligomeric assemblies, particularly for baseplate components and enzymatic domains, while cryo-electron microscopy has increasingly dominated since the 2010s, providing near-atomic resolution structures of the complete virion, the baseplate in various conformational states, and large macromolecular assemblies like the tail-baseplate complex, with cryo-EM now representing roughly 40-50% of structural depositions for T4 late proteins, though the exact proportion continues to shift toward cryo-EM for large assembly characterization.",383,423,0.007494,True,94.33,"Perfect! Now I have all the data I need. Let me synthesize the answer based on the query results:

The reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 comprise a sophisticated structural assembly organized into three GO-annotated functional modules: capsid components (major capsid protein gp23 and capsid vertex protein gp24), baseplate components (16 baseplate proteins including gp5-11, gp25, gp27, gp48, gp53-54, and gp5.4), and tail components (tail sheath protein gp18, tail tube protein gp19, tail tube terminator protein gp3, portal protein gp20, fibritin, short tail fiber gp12, long tail fibers gp35-37, and tail assembly proteins including tape measure protein gp29 and completion protein gp15). Despite their predominantly structural designations, three late proteins encode enzymatic activities: the pre-baseplate central spike protein Gp5 and puncturing device gp5.4 both possess peptidoglycan hydrolase activity (EC 3.2.1.17/lysozyme activity) for host cell wall penetration during infection, while the structural annotations mask these catalytic functions embedded within otherwise architectural components of the virion's infection machinery. Experimental structural coverage of these 32 reviewed late proteins reveals substantial characterization with at least 20 proteins having PDB depositions, though coverage varies dramatically from fibritin with 117 structures to uncharacterized proteins with zero; the structural biology portfolio demonstrates overwhelming dominance of X-ray crystallography with 956 entries (87.4%) compared to cryo-electron microscopy with 117 entries (10.7%), reflecting the historical primacy of crystallographic methods for T4 phage structural biology, though the substantial cryo-EM contribution captures increasingly important higher-order assemblies and macromolecular complexes that complement the atomic-resolution crystallographic characterization of individual protein components.",30,3116,0.6403173999999999,0.647811,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",3,3,5,4,15,Provides reasonable structural overview with many correct protein names but overestimates total count (40-50 vs ideal 25).

Eubacteriales (formerly Clostridiales) ranks second with 19 nifH/nifD genes from 8 organisms, including Clostridium pasteurianum DSM 525 (7 genes) as the dominant contributor, alongside other anaerobic nitrogen fixers such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum (3 genes) and Clostridium beijerinckii (2 genes). Burkholderiales has 11 genes from 5 organisms including the endophyte Herbaspirillum seropedicae, while Pseudomonadales has only 7 genes from 2 organisms, notably Azotobacter chroococcum. The dominance of Hyphomicrobiales (66 genes, 64% of the 103 genes in these four orders) reflects the extensive genome sequencing of alpha-proteobacterial diazotrophs and the multiple nifH/nifD paralogs retained in some of these organisms. Across the full NCBI Gene database, 375 nifH/nifD genes span 174 organisms, demonstrating that nitrogen fixation capability is phylogenetically scattered well beyond these four orders, including in diverse Archaea (e.g., Methanocaldococcus) and sulfate-reducing bacteria.

Notable nitrogen-fixing genera include Burkholderia (especially the plant-associated species), Cupriavidus (formerly Ralstonia), Herbaspirillum, and various diazotrophic members that are significant in both free-living and symbiotic associations with plants. While Hyphomicrobiales also contains important nitrogen-fixing taxa (such as Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium in root nodule symbioses), and some members of Pseudomonadales possess nitrogen fixation capability, the Burkholderiales order has experienced extensive genomic sequencing efforts due to its agricultural and biotechnological importance, resulting in a larger representation of nif genes in genomic databases.

DSM 101043 (BacDive ID 131407) is documented to grow in Cyanobacteria Medium BG11-, which is a nitrogen-free medium used to induce heterocyst formation in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. A MediaDive query confirmed zero nitrogen-containing ingredients (no nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, or urea) in BG11-, establishing that the strain grows without any external fixed-nitrogen source. BG11- medium lacks fixed nitrogen sources, requiring nitrogen-fixing strains like Anabaena to form specialized heterocyst cells for atmospheric nitrogen fixation. This psychrophilic strain isolated from sediment can fix atmospheric nitrogen through the nitrogenase enzyme complex housed within heterocysts, specialized anaerobic cells that protect oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase from photosynthetic oxygen production. The cross-database integration between BacDive (strain characterization) and MediaDive (validated cultivation protocols) confirms this nitrogen-independent growth capability.
",True,6.36,"Anabaena sp. DSM 101043, like other members of the genus Anabaena, is a filamentous cyanobacterium capable of nitrogen fixation and can grow in nitrogen-free BG11- medium (also known as BG110 or BG11₀). This medium is specifically formulated by omitting sodium nitrate from the standard BG11 medium, creating nitrogen-depleted conditions that induce the differentiation of specialized cells called heterocysts. These heterocysts provide an oxygen-free microenvironment necessary for the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase enzyme complex to convert atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) into ammonia, which the organism then uses for biosynthesis. The ability to grow diazotrophically in nitrogen-free medium is a defining characteristic of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and makes BG11- medium a standard tool for studying and cultivating strains like Anabaena sp.

The predominance of mupA in surveillance records reflects its plasmid-mediated transmissibility, which facilitates its spread among clinical MRSA lineages, whereas ileS mutations arise independently and are less common. The distinction between high-level (mupA) and low-level (ileS mutations) resistance has direct clinical implications, as high-level resistance compromises mupirocin use for MRSA decolonization regimens.
",True,7.91,"Based on genomic resistance surveillance records for Staphylococcus aureus (NCBI taxon 1280), the AMR element symbols associated with mupirocin resistance include mupA (also known as ileS2), which is the most commonly detected element and typically appears in hundreds to thousands of isolate records depending on the surveillance database. The mupB element (also known as ileS3) represents another mupirocin resistance determinant, though it generally appears in fewer isolate records than mupA. These genes encode alternative isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes that confer resistance to mupirocin by bypassing the inhibition of the native chromosomal ileS gene. Chromosomal mutations in the native ileS gene itself can also confer low-level mupirocin resistance and may be documented in surveillance records, though they are typically less frequently cataloged as discrete AMR elements compared to the acquired mupA and mupB genes. The exact counts of isolate records for each element vary significantly across different surveillance systems and time periods, with mupA generally being the predominant resistance mechanism identified in clinical isolates, particularly in healthcare-associated MRSA strains where high-level mupirocin resistance has emerged due to widespread topical mupirocin use for decolonization.",365,292,0.005475,True,35.69,"Excellent!

When distributed across eight GO cellular component subcategories using structured ontology IRIs, 49 of these proteins are annotated to the general proteasome complex (GO:0000502), while the 20S core complex (GO:0005839) accounts for 18 proteins, the accessory complex (GO:0022624) for 16, the core beta-subunit complex (GO:0019774) for 11, the regulatory particle base subcomplex (GO:0008540) for 9, the lid subcomplex (GO:0008541) for 8, the alpha-subunit complex (GO:0019773) for 8, and the 19S regulatory particle (GO:0005838) for 7. The sum of these category counts reaches 126 annotations for 52 uniquely annotated proteins (arithmetic verification: 126 > 52 = valid overlap), reflecting extensive multi-subcomplex co-annotation — for example, a beta subunit is simultaneously annotated to the general proteasome complex, the 20S core, and the beta-subunit complex. Four proteins lack the general GO:0000502 annotation entirely: PSMF1 (PI31 inhibitor), PSME4 (PA200 activator), PSB11 (inducible beta-11), and PSMA8 (testis-specific alpha-8). Three of them (PSMF1, PSB11, PSMA8) still appear in subcomplex categories (GO:0005839, GO:0019774, GO:0019773 respectively), while PSME4 carries none of the eight GO subcomplex annotations, consistent with its role as an externally docking activator rather than a structural subunit. Cross-referencing with ChEMBL reveals that 22 of the 53 proteins (41.5%) are registered as human single-protein drug targets, with all eight canonical beta subunits included — consistent with the clinical use of proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib that target the beta5 catalytic subunit (PSMB5).
",True,15.6,"The human proteasome protein landscape defined by UniProt keyword KW-0647 comprises approximately 45-50 proteins that form a multi-catalytic proteolytic complex essential for regulated protein degradation. These proteins distribute across three major structural and functional categories based on GO cellular component annotations: the 20S core particle contains 14 constitutive subunits (7 α-type and 7 β-type subunits arranged in four stacked rings) plus 3 immunoproteasome-specific catalytic subunits (β1i/PSMB9, β2i/PSMB10, β5i/PSMB8) and thymoproteasome subunit β5t/PSMB11; the 19S regulatory particle (PA700) consists of approximately 19 subunits divided into base (6 ATPases: PSMC1-6, plus 4 non-ATPases: PSMD1, 2, 4, 13) and lid (9 non-ATPase subunits including deubiquitinases PSMD14 and multiple PSMD proteins) subcomplexes; and accessory/alternative regulatory complexes include the 11S/PA28 activators (PSME1-4), PA200/PSME4, and assembly chaperones (POMP, PAC1-4/PSMG1-4). Multi-subcomplex annotation overlap is minimal since most subunits are structurally committed to specific subcomplexes, though assembly chaperones transiently associate with multiple complexes and certain proteins like ADRM1/RPN13 bridge regulatory and core particles. Regarding therapeutic relevance, the proteasome represents a validated drug target class with approximately 8-12 proteins catalogued in ChEMBL, representing roughly 16-24% of the proteasome proteome, predominantly the catalytic β subunits (PSMB5, PSMB8, PSMB9, PSMB10) targeted by FDA-approved inhibitors like bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib for multiple myeloma treatment, alongside emerging targets among regulatory subunits and deubiquitinases.",381,514,0.008853,True,109.21,"Perfect!

   - 19S regulatory base: 9 proteins
   - 19S regulatory lid: 8 proteins  
   - Accessory complex: 16 proteins
3. **Multi-subcomplex annotations**: Several proteins (19S base and lid proteins) are also annotated to ""proteasome accessory complex""
4. **ChEMBL drug targets**: 23 proteins with specific ChEMBL target IDs that have bioactivity data (excluding the generic CHEMBL2364701 which represents the whole 26S proteasome complex)

Let me count the proteins more precisely by analyzing the data I have:

From the subcomplex data:
- 20S core (in20S=1): 18 proteins
- 19S base only (in19Sbase=1, in19Slid=0): 9 proteins
- 19S lid only (in19Sbase=0, in19Slid=1): 3 proteins (ADRM1, SEM1, and one other)
- Both 19S base AND accessory: 6 proteins (overlap)
- Both 19S lid AND accessory: 4 proteins (overlap)
- Accessory only (no core or regulatory): varies
- Other/unclassified: proteins with no specific subcomplex GO annotation

ChEMBL drug targets: 23 unique proteins have ChEMBL target IDs with bioactivity data (all targets shown in the last query except CHEMBL2364701 which is the complex itself, not individual proteins - though 20 proteins map to it, they also have other individual target IDs in many cases).

The human proteasome landscape as defined by UniProt keyword KW-0647 encompasses 53 manually reviewed proteins, distributed across three major GO cellular component subcomplexes: 18 proteins localize to the 20S core complex (including 7 alpha-subunit and 11 beta-subunit components), 9 proteins form the 19S regulatory particle base subcomplex, and 8 proteins constitute the 19S regulatory particle lid subcomplex, while 16 proteins are annotated to the proteasome accessory complex category. Notably, multi-subcomplex annotation is prevalent, with 6 proteins from the 19S base and 4 proteins from the 19S lid also carrying accessory complex annotations, reflecting their dual functional roles in both core regulatory and modulatory activities. Cross-referencing to ChEMBL reveals that 23 proteins (43% of the landscape) are represented as drug targets with documented bioactivity measurements, ranging from extensively characterized targets such as the beta-5 subunit (PSMB5/CHEMBL4662, 3,453 activities) and beta-1 subunit (PSMB1/CHEMBL4208, 1,141 activities) to emerging targets with more limited datasets, demonstrating substantial pharmaceutical interest in proteasome-directed therapeutic intervention across multiple subcomplex components.",30,4614,0.5556532999999999,0.564506,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__togoid_convertId, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",3,4,5,4,16,"Approximate protein count (45-50 vs 53), correct subunit type descriptions, but lacks specific GO subcategory and ChEMBL data from ideal.",4,4,3,3,14,"Matches total (53 proteins), provides subcomplex breakdown and ChEMBL target count (23).

This substantial variant burden reflects KCNQ2's role as the causal gene for both the severe DEE7 (developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 7, MONDO:0013387) and the milder benign familial neonatal convulsions type 1, making it a major target of clinical sequencing in pediatric epilepsy. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 encode the Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits that co-assemble to form the neuronal M-channel responsible for regulating neuronal excitability; KCNQ2 variants are more frequently pathogenic and more clinically diverse in severity than KCNQ3 variants, which mainly cause the milder BFNC2 (MONDO:0007366). KCNT1 encodes the sodium-activated KNa1.1 (SLACK) channel and causes the severe epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS, MONDO:0100025), while KCNB1 encodes the Kv2.1 delayed-rectifier channel associated with DEE34 (MONDO:0014718); both have a smaller but clinically significant variant spectrum compared to KCNQ2.
",True,8.18,"**KCNQ2**

KCNQ2 has the greatest number of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants documented in ClinVar among these four voltage-gated potassium channel genes. This gene is associated with benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS) and neonatal-onset epileptic encephalopathy, representing a broader phenotypic spectrum that has been extensively characterized since its discovery in the 1990s.

The most frequently resistant bacterial species are Escherichia coli (853 resistant isolates), Shigella sonnei (729), Salmonella enterica (334), Klebsiella pneumoniae (220), and Shigella flexneri (150); Staphylococcus aureus (33) and Enterococcus faecium also contribute. Taxonomically, the dominant resistant organisms—E. coli, Shigella, Klebsiella, and Salmonella—all belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria, whereas Staphylococcus aureus (family Staphylococcaceae) and Enterococcus faecium (family Enterococcaceae) represent Firmicutes exceptions. Genotypically, AMRportal contains 25,236 TRIMETHOPRIM-class resistance features; the predominant gene family is dhfrI with multiple allelic variants (dhfrI_1: 3,855; dhfrI_2: 3,851; dhfrI: 2,784; dhfrI_3–7: additional records totaling ~11,583), followed by folA variants (~1,873), dfrD variants (~1,032), and dfrA variants (~520)—all encoding dihydrofolate reductase (NCBI Gene: folA described as ""dihydrofolate reductase""; dfrA as ""dihydrofolate reductase""), the enzyme target of trimethoprim that inhibits bacterial tetrahydrofolate synthesis. Among the 2,073 geographically annotated resistant isolates, Europe shows the highest burden (823), followed by Oceania (698), Asia (392), Africa (118), and the Americas (42), a distribution that reflects global surveillance intensity and the concentration of large-scale clinical monitoring programs in Europe and Australasia.
",True,10.7,"Trimethoprim resistance is most prominently observed in Enterobacteriaceae (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella species), Staphylococcaceae (particularly Staphylococcus aureus), and Streptococcaceae (notably Streptococcus pneumoniae), with E. coli representing the most frequently resistant species across clinical and environmental settings. The predominant resistance mechanisms involve the *dfr* gene family, which encodes dihydrofolate reductase enzymes with altered substrate binding that maintain catalytic function while exhibiting reduced trimethoprim affinity; major variants include *dfrA* genes (over 30 subtypes, common in Gram-negative bacteria), *dfrB* genes (primarily in Gram-positives), and *dfrG* genes, all of which bypass trimethoprim inhibition through structural modifications to the active site. Chromosomal mutations in the native *folA* gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase also confer resistance through target site modification, though acquired *dfr* genes carried on mobile genetic elements represent the more prevalent mechanism. Geographic distribution shows worldwide dissemination, with particularly high resistance rates documented in South and Southeast Asia (India, Bangladesh, Thailand reporting 40-80% resistance in E. coli isolates), sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America, correlating with regions of high antibiotic consumption and limited antimicrobial stewardship; lower but increasing rates occur in North America and Europe (typically 15-30% in urinary E. coli isolates), while certain developing regions exhibit near-universal resistance in common pathogens due to unregulated antibiotic use and environmental contamination from pharmaceutical manufacturing and agricultural runoff.",351,396,0.006993,True,85.16,"Trimethoprim resistance is most prevalent in Enterobacteriaceae family members, with Escherichia coli exhibiting the highest phenotypic resistance (853 resistant isolates) followed by Shigella sonnei (729), Salmonella enterica (334), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (220), while Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcaceae family, 33 isolates) and Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii (Moraxellaceae family, 22 isolates) show substantially lower resistance frequencies.

  - ELECTRON MICROSCOPY","X-RAY DIFFRACTION accounts for the greatest number of distinct structural entries for reviewed human serine proteases, with 1,880 PDB entries, vastly outnumbering ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (137 entries) and SOLUTION NMR (37 entries). This distribution was determined by cross-referencing the 141 reviewed human serine protease sequences from UniProt Swiss-Prot (keyword KW-0720, Homo sapiens) against all PDB entries via the UniProt accession links in the structure database. The total of 2,055 unique PDB entries spans five experimental techniques; two minor methods — ELECTRON CRYSTALLOGRAPHY (1 entry) and NEUTRON DIFFRACTION (1 entry) — also appear. The 2,056 method-level annotations for 2,055 unique entries indicate that one entry was deposited under two experimental methods (valid overlap). The overwhelming dominance of X-ray crystallography (91.5% of entries) reflects the historical tractability of serine proteases for crystal formation: their well-defined active-site geometry, availability of high-affinity inhibitor co-crystals, and pharmaceutical relevance as drug targets have driven decades of intensive crystallographic campaigns. Electron microscopy is still underrepresented for this family because most clinically relevant serine proteases are monomeric enzymes with molecular weights below ~100 kDa, at the lower end of optimal cryo-EM resolution, whereas solution NMR captures only the smaller members of the family.
",True,8.34,"X-RAY DIFFRACTION

X-ray crystallography (X-ray diffraction) accounts for the vast majority of three-dimensional structure entries for reviewed human serine proteases in the Protein Data Bank. This dominance reflects several practical advantages of the technique for studying these proteins: serine proteases are generally well-suited to crystallization due to their compact, stable domains; they are often of moderate size (typically 20-35 kDa for the catalytic domain), which is ideal for crystallographic studies; and there has been extensive structural characterization of medically important serine proteases like thrombin, factor Xa, trypsin, and various kallikreins using this method. While solution NMR has contributed some structures, it is limited by the size constraints of the technique and the fact that many serine proteases exceed the optimal molecular weight range for traditional NMR structure determination. Electron microscopy, particularly cryo-EM, has emerged as a powerful technique for large macromolecular complexes but has been less commonly applied to individual serine protease domains, which are generally too small to benefit from its advantages and fall well within the size range optimally studied by crystallography.",256,260,0.004668,True,107.21,"Perfect!

question_038,choice,"Among the five Mus musculus limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs Capn3, Dysf, Lmna, Ano5, and Plec, which has the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts in Ensembl GRCm39?

Choose one of the following options:
  - Capn3
  - Dysf
  - Lmna
  - Ano5
  - Plec","Among the five Mus musculus limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs compared, Plec (encoding plectin, the mouse ortholog of the human LGMD2Q gene PLEC) has by far the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts in Ensembl GRCm39 with 21 isoforms, followed by Dysf (dysferlin, LGMD2B ortholog) with 12, Capn3 (calpain 3, LGMD2A ortholog) with 10, Lmna (lamin A, LGMD1B ortholog) with 4, and Ano5 (anoctamin 5, LGMD2L ortholog) with 3. Plec's exceptional transcript diversity reflects its unique genomic architecture: the mouse Plec gene encodes at least 11 alternative first exons (1a–1j and a common exon 2) that each splice into a shared downstream coding region, producing tissue-specific isoforms directed to distinct subcellular compartments — for example, isoform 1a targets hemidesmosomes in epithelia while isoform 1f localises to costameres and Z-discs in striated muscle. Dysf's 12 isoforms reflect alternative splicing of its tandem C2 domain array, relevant to its role in membrane repair at the sarcolemma. Capn3's 10 isoforms include the muscle-specific p94 form and lens isoform Lp82 arising from alternative promoter usage. By contrast, Lmna (4 isoforms, primarily lamin A and lamin C from alternative splicing at exon 10) and Ano5 (3 isoforms) are architecturally simpler. The striking isoform count difference between Plec and Ano5 (21 vs. 3) therefore does not reflect clinical severity but rather the mechanistic complexity of their membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding roles versus channel/lipid scramblase functions.
",True,7.15,"The correct answer is **Lmna**.

Lmna (Lamin A/C) has the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts among these five mouse genes in Ensembl GRCm39. The Lmna gene encodes nuclear lamina proteins that are subject to extensive alternative splicing, producing multiple protein isoforms including lamin A, lamin C, and several other variants through differential promoter usage and alternative splicing events. This complex splicing pattern results in numerous distinct protein-coding transcripts. In contrast, the other genes—Capn3 (calpain-3), Dysf (dysferlin), Ano5 (anoctamin-5), and Plec (plectin)—while they may have alternative transcripts, typically have fewer protein-coding variants annotated in Ensembl. The functional diversity of nuclear lamins and their tissue-specific expression patterns necessitate this transcript complexity, which is reflected in the higher number of protein-coding transcript annotations for Lmna compared to the other limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-associated genes.",284,245,0.004527,True,32.98,"Perfect!

SCN5A encodes the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 and is the primary causal gene for Brugada syndrome, responsible for 15–30% of cases through loss-of-function variants; its ChEMBL entry reflects its central role as a drug target for antiarrhythmic compounds and as a cardiac safety liability. The potassium channels KCNH2 (hERG) and KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) are prominent ChEMBL targets because inhibition of hERG is a major mechanism of drug-induced QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. CACNA1C encodes the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2, a target for dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. RYR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) is targeted by flecainide and other agents used in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, a related channelopathy with substantial overlap in the research literature. The complete overlap between the high-frequency co-annotation set and ChEMBL pharmacological targets reflects the ion-channel-centric pathophysiology of Brugada syndrome and the translational significance of these genes in cardiac drug development and safety pharmacology.

Of the eleven human siglec-family glycoproteins represented in GlyCosmos (SIGLEC5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16), these four are the only members for which site-resolved glycoproteomic mass spectrometry data have been curated: SIGLEC5 has 34 annotated glycosylation sites with 33 associated glycan structures (GlyConnect entry 568), SIGLEC7 has 32 sites with 31 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 569), SIGLEC8 has 28 sites with 27 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 570), and SIGLEC14 has 14 sites with 9 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 1978). The remaining seven siglecs (SIGLEC6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16) are recorded in GlyCosmos with glycosylation site predictions from GlyGen but lack curated per-site glycan composition data. Three of the four characterized siglecs (SIGLEC5, 7, 8) are CD33-related inhibitory receptors carrying cytoplasmic ITIMs, while SIGLEC14 is an activating receptor paired with DAP12; all four are expressed primarily on myeloid or NK cells and play roles in immune tolerance, allergy regulation, and innate immune modulation. Dense N-glycosylation of siglec ectodomains is biologically significant because the glycan shield can occlude the V-set sialic acid-binding domain, favoring cis-ligand masking on the cell surface over trans-ligand engagement, and modulating receptor clustering and signaling thresholds.
",True,10.07,"Based on current glycoproteomic databases, several human siglec proteins have experimentally characterized N-glycan structures at specific glycosylation sites. Siglec-1 (sialoadhesin/CD169) has documented N-glycan structures at multiple sites including N67, N91, N187, and N438, with complex-type glycans being predominant. Siglec-2 (CD22) has characterized glycosylation at sites N67, N101, N112, N135, N164, and N231, featuring mainly complex bi- and tri-antennary structures with variable sialylation and fucosylation. Siglec-3 (CD33) has experimentally validated N-glycans at N97 and N103, displaying complex-type glycans with core fucosylation. Siglec-5 has characterized sites at N71, N118, and N166, while Siglec-7 has documented glycosylation at N94, N138, and N169, both carrying predominantly complex-type structures. Siglec-9 has experimentally determined N-glycans at N82, N115, and N270, featuring sialylated complex-type glycans. Siglec-10 has characterized sites at N120 and N191 with complex bi-antennary structures.

question_045,summary,"What are the structural characteristics of 3-demethylubiquinones as intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis, and how are they enzymatically converted to ubiquinones?","3-Demethylubiquinones are penultimate intermediates in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway that differ from their mature ubiquinone counterparts by a single structural feature: a free hydroxyl group (-OH) at ring position 3 instead of the methoxyl group (-OCH3) found in ubiquinones, classifying them ontologically as monohydroxy-1,4-benzoquinones within the broader ubiquinone family. This single substituent difference translates to a molecular mass difference of approximately 14 Da for each chain-length variant; for example, 3-demethylubiquinone-9 has the molecular formula C53H80O4 with a molecular weight of 781.2 Da (compared to 795.2 Da for ubiquinone-9), while 3-demethylubiquinone-10 has the formula C58H88O4 with a molecular weight of 849.3 Da (compared to 863.3 Da for coenzyme Q10). Their conversion to ubiquinones is catalyzed by SAM-dependent O-methyltransferases in a reaction where S-adenosyl-L-methionine donates a methyl group to the hydroxyl at position 3, yielding the corresponding ubiquinol (reduced) or ubiquinone (oxidized) product along with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. The Rhea database catalogues 7 approved reactions of this type, comprising 2 generic reactions covering the entire class of 3-demethylubiquinone and 3-demethylubiquinol species and 5 chain-length-specific reactions for the n=6, n=7, n=8, n=9, and n=10 polyprenyl variants that predominate across different organisms.
",True,9.14,"3-Demethylubiquinones are biosynthetic intermediates characterized by a benzoquinone ring system with a polyisoprenoid tail at position 6, a methoxy group at position 2, and hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 5, notably lacking the methoxy group at position 3 that is present in mature ubiquinones. The structural formula consists of 2-methoxy-3,5-dihydroxy-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone, where the polyprenyl side chain length varies depending on the organism (typically 6-10 isoprene units). The enzymatic conversion of 3-demethylubiquinones to ubiquinones is catalyzed by the O-methyltransferase Coq3 (also known as Ubiε in some organisms), which transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to the hydroxyl group at position 3 of the benzoquinone ring. This methylation reaction produces S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine as a byproduct and generates the fully methylated ubiquinone with methoxy groups at both positions 2 and 3. Coq3 functions as part of the larger Coq protein complex localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane in eukaryotes or the plasma membrane in bacteria, where it catalyzes one of the final steps in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme demonstrates specificity for the 3-position hydroxyl group and requires the presence of the polyisoprenoid tail for substrate recognition and efficient catalysis.",345,376,0.006675,True,89.94,"Excellent! Now I have all the information needed to provide a comprehensive answer. Let me compile the final response:

3-Demethylubiquinones are polyprenylbenzoquinone intermediates in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway that possess a benzoquinone ring with a methoxy group at position 6, a hydroxyl group at position 5, a methyl group at position 3, and a variable-length all-trans-polyprenyl side chain at position 2, with the specific structural formula exemplified by 3-demethylubiquinone-9 (C53H80O4) and 3-demethylubiquinone-10 (C58H88O4) for species with 9 and 10 isoprenoid units respectively. These intermediates are formed through hydroxylation of 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-polyprenyl)benzoquinones by an NADH-dependent monooxygenase (EC 1.14.13.253), which catalyzes demethylation coupled with hydroxylation at the 5-position of the benzoquinone ring using molecular oxygen as a cosubstrate. The final enzymatic conversion to ubiquinones is catalyzed by ubiquinone biosynthesis O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.64), which transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the 5-hydroxyl position of 3-demethylubiquinone, yielding ubiquinone (with 5,6-dimethoxy substitution) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine as products, thereby completing the biosynthesis of the redox-active ubiquinone molecules essential for mitochondrial electron transport.",37,2613,0.37765875,0.384334,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__ols__search, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_molecule, mcp__ols__fetch, mcp__ols__fetch, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",3,3,5,4,15,Describes ring substituents and methyltransferase conversion.

question_046,yes_no,"Does AXIN1, the scaffold protein that nucleates the beta-catenin destruction complex in canonical Wnt signaling, have a phosphorylated form with specifically annotated concurrent phosphorylation at threonine and serine residues documented in any curated human Wnt pathway entry?","AXIN1 (UniProt O15169, AXIN1_HUMAN), a manually reviewed human protein, does indeed have a phosphorylated form with specifically annotated concurrent threonine and serine modifications curated in the Reactome human pathway database. The phosphorylated isoform designated p-T481,S486,S493-AXIN1 carries three co-occurring modifications: O-phospho-L-threonine at position 481 and O-phospho-L-serine at positions 486 and 493. These phosphorylation events are documented within the curated biochemical reaction ""AXIN is phosphorylated in the destruction complex"" (R-HSA-5229343), which is a component of the human pathway ""Degradation of beta-catenin by the destruction complex"" (R-HSA-195253), itself nested within the broader ""Signaling by WNT"" hierarchy (R-HSA-195721). Mechanistically, the destruction complex—assembled by AXIN1 as scaffold, together with APC, CK1, and GSK3-beta—sequentially phosphorylates beta-catenin to mark it for proteasomal degradation; the phosphorylation of AXIN1 itself at T481, S486, and S493 enhances its stability within the complex and potentiates beta-catenin turnover, thereby maintaining the off-state of canonical Wnt signaling in the absence of Wnt ligand.
",True,7.78,"AXIN1, functioning as the central scaffold protein in the beta-catenin destruction complex, undergoes multiple post-translational modifications including phosphorylation at both serine and threonine residues. Curated pathway databases such as PhosphoSitePlus, Reactome, and WikiPathways document AXIN1 phosphorylation at numerous sites, with several serine residues (including S264, S289, S290, S323, S326, S330, S489) and threonine residues (including T179, T183, T212, T219, T252) experimentally identified through mass spectrometry and other proteomic approaches. These phosphorylation events are mediated by various kinases within the Wnt signaling context, including GSK3β, which itself is a core component of the destruction complex. The concurrent phosphorylation at multiple serine and threonine sites on AXIN1 is documented in curated human Wnt pathway entries, though the specific functional consequences of individual phosphorylation events vary—some modifications enhance AXIN1 stability and destruction complex activity, while others may regulate protein-protein interactions with APC, GSK3β, CK1, or beta-catenin itself. These multi-site phosphorylation patterns represent a regulatory mechanism controlling destruction complex assembly, stability, and activity in both the Wnt-off and Wnt-on states of the canonical pathway.",368,323,0.005949,True,104.14,"Perfect!

encodes a DNA helicase required for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision
repair, in the molecular pathogenesis of Cockayne syndrome — an autosomal
recessive disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, photosensitivity,

Ten distinct reviewed human UniProt protein entries carry the GO biological process annotation for 'coenzyme A biosynthetic process' (GO:0015937): Q96CD2 (phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase), Q9NVE7 (4'-phosphopantetheine phosphatase/inactive PANK4), Q9H999 (pantothenate kinase 3), Q9HAB8 (phosphopantothenate-cysteine ligase), Q13057 (bifunctional coenzyme A synthase), Q8TE04 (pantothenate kinase 1), O00154 (cytosolic acyl-CoA thioesterase), Q9BZ23 (pantothenate kinase 2, mitochondrial), P24752 (acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, mitochondrial), and Q8WVC6 (dephospho-CoA kinase domain-containing protein). These proteins localize to both the cytosol and mitochondria, with PANK2 predominantly mitochondrial and COASY primarily cytosolic but also present in the mitochondrial matrix, while other pathway enzymes function in the cytosol or mitochondrial intermembrane space. Five of these ten proteins are registered as drug targets in ChEMBL: CHEMBL3407328 (PANK3), CHEMBL4105867 (bifunctional CoA synthase), CHEMBL3407326 (PANK1), CHEMBL3407327 (PANK2), and CHEMBL2616 (acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase), reflecting pharmaceutical interest in modulating CoA metabolism for therapeutic applications including neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation and metabolic disorders.",49,4729,0.70499255,0.711287,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__togoid_getAllRelation, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__togoid_convertId, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_target, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esummary, ReadMcpResourceTool, Bash, Bash",3,4,5,4,16,"Provides 5 reactions (vs ideal 7), correct 3 EC classes, and 5 UniProt proteins.

question_050,choice,"Among Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which species has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records?

Choose one of the following options:
  - Klebsiella pneumoniae
  - Acinetobacter baumannii
  - Salmonella enterica
  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Salmonella enterica has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records, with 23 distinct classes, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16), and Acinetobacter baumannii (14). The 28 total unique classes across all four species (sum of per-species counts = 75; 75 > 28, indicating 47 class-instances are shared, with core classes such as BETA-LACTAM, AMINOGLYCOSIDE, QUINOLONE, TETRACYCLINE, and SULFONAMIDE present in all four species) reflects extensive horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants among Gram-negative pathogens. Salmonella enterica's broader drug-class repertoire is consistent with its diverse ecological niches spanning human clinical, livestock, and environmental reservoirs, which expose bacterial populations to a wide range of selective antibiotic pressures and facilitate acquisition of resistance genes from taxonomically distant organisms; distinctive Salmonella classes include BLEOMYCIN, STREPTOTHRICIN, RIFAMYCIN, FOSFOMYCIN, and GLYCOPEPTIDE. Notably, this class-breadth ranking diverges from gene-symbol diversity: K. pneumoniae has substantially more distinct gene symbols in AMRPortal but a narrower class range than Salmonella by just one class, reflecting K. pneumoniae's depth in a few resistance mechanisms (especially BETA-LACTAM diversity via ESBLs and carbapenemases) rather than breadth across classes. Acinetobacter baumannii, despite its clinical reputation as extensively drug-resistant, shows the fewest distinct drug classes (14) among the four ESKAPE pathogens in current surveillance records, as its resistance phenotype is largely driven by a concentrated set of OXA-type carbapenemases and efflux pump mechanisms rather than broad class diversification.
",True,8.07,"**Klebsiella pneumoniae** is the correct answer.

Klebsiella pneumoniae has the greatest diversity of genotypic resistance mechanisms documented in surveillance records, spanning the most distinct antibiotic drug classes. This species commonly harbors resistance genes affecting beta-lactams (including carbapenems via KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like carbapenemases), aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, phenicols, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, fosfomycin, and colistin (mcr genes). K. pneumoniae's notorious ability to accumulate multiple resistance determinants on mobile genetic elements, combined with its clinical significance as both a nosocomial and community pathogen, has led to extensive genotypic surveillance capturing resistance to virtually all major antibiotic classes used in gram-negative infections. While P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii are also highly resistant pathogens, their resistance profiles, though clinically challenging, typically span fewer distinct drug classes in routine genotypic surveillance. Salmonella enterica surveillance focuses more narrowly on resistance relevant to enteric infections, primarily covering fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and a few other classes, resulting in less diversity in documented resistance gene classes compared to K. pneumoniae.",289,294,0.005277,True,39.69,"Perfect! The results are comprehensive and valid. The AMR classes represent distinct antibiotic drug classes (and combinations). Salmonella enterica has 24 distinct AMR classes in its genotypic resistance surveillance records, which is the highest among the four species.

**Salmonella enterica**

Salmonella enterica has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes (24) represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records among the four species. Klebsiella pneumoniae follows with 22 distinct classes, then Pseudomonas aeruginosa with 16, and Acinetobacter baumannii with 14. The genotypic AMR features in the AMR Portal database categorize resistance genes and mutations by drug class, including single classes like beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, quinolone, and tetracycline, as well as multi-drug resistance categories. Salmonella enterica's broader resistance gene repertoire reflects its genetic diversity and the selective pressures from antibiotic use in both clinical and agricultural settings.",20,1075,0.19468,0.199957,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",1,3,5,4,13,Selects Klebsiella pneumoniae which is incorrect. Ideal answer is Salmonella enterica with 23 classes.,5,5,5,4,19,Correctly identifies Salmonella enterica (24 classes) with counts for all four species closely matching ideal.
