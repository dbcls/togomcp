The exact count depends on the database snapshot; the RDF portal query returned 20 current records at time of query, while the live NCBI ClinVar release contains ≥66 such variants. Variants include missense substitutions affecting functionally critical residues in the alpha-crystallin domain (e.g., c.379C>T p.Arg127Trp, c.404C>T p.Ser135Phe, c.406C>T p.Arg136Trp, c.418C>G p.Arg140Gly, c.545C>T p.Pro182Leu), as well as frameshift and nonsense variants (e.g., c.109dup p.Arg37fs (Likely pathogenic), c.532G>T p.Glu178Ter (Likely pathogenic)). Several large deletions at the HSPB1 locus on chromosome 7q11.23 also appear in the dataset.

question_004,summary,Summarize the distribution of melatonin biosynthesis enzymes across species and characterize their molecular functions and the chemical intermediates involved.,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are distributed across 16 species spanning three kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi), with 33 reviewed proteins in total. Mammals account for 14 proteins across 9 taxa, including two human paralogs (AANAT and ASMT), with coverage extending to mouse, rat, cattle, sheep, macaque, hamster, chimpanzee, and Mus musculus molossinus. Plants contribute 14 proteins from 4 taxa: Arabidopsis thaliana (4 proteins), Oryza sativa subsp. japonica (7 proteins, the most of any single organism), Oryza sativa subsp. indica (1 protein), and Zea mays (2 proteins). Additional representatives include two bird proteins in Gallus gallus, two insect proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, and one fungal protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The pathway proceeds through two enzymatic steps acting on distinct chemical intermediates: first, aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT, GO:0004059, a subclass of N-acetyltransferase activity) converts serotonin (CHEBI:28790, C10H12N2O) to N-acetylserotonin (CHEBI:17697, C12H14N2O2); then acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT, GO:0017096, a subclass of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity) converts N-acetylserotonin to melatonin (CHEBI:16796, C13H16N2O2). Exactly 17 proteins are annotated with AANAT activity and 16 with ASMT activity, with no overlap. This enzymatic conservation across evolutionarily distant taxa — from yeast to plants to mammals — indicates an ancient origin of the two-step melatonin biosynthesis mechanism, with the pathway starting from tryptophan (CHEBI:27897, C11H12N2O2) via serotonin as the upstream precursor.
",True,10.38,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are distributed across diverse taxonomic groups, including animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists, though the specific enzyme complement and pathways vary considerably among lineages. In vertebrates, the canonical pathway involves four sequential enzymatic steps: tryptophan hydroxylase converts L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase converts this to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) acetylates serotonin to N-acetylserotonin, and acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT, also called hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase or HIOMT) methylates this intermediate to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). AANAT is the rate-limiting enzyme in vertebrates and exhibits high substrate specificity for serotonin, catalyzing the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the amino group of serotonin. ASMT then catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to the 5-hydroxyl position of N-acetylserotonin, producing S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine as a byproduct. In plants and some non-vertebrate organisms, alternative pathways exist where the order of acetylation and methylation can be reversed, with tryptamine decarboxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase, serotonin N-acetyltransferase, and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase-like enzymes performing analogous functions, though these enzymes often have broader substrate specificities and different regulatory mechanisms compared to their vertebrate counterparts, reflecting independent evolutionary origins of melatonin synthesis capacity.",333,442,0.007629,True,84.44,"Melatonin biosynthesis occurs through a four-step enzymatic pathway beginning with L-tryptophan and involves two principal enzymes that exhibit distinct phylogenetic distributions across life domains. The pathway first converts L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan via tryptophan 5-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.4), a mixed-function oxygenase that catalyzes hydroxylation requiring NADPH and molecular oxygen as cofactors. This enzyme is distributed primarily among animals, including humans, rodents, primates, birds, and invertebrates such as Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, with two distinct isoforms (TPH1 and TPH2) characterized in vertebrates. The second step employs aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28), which converts 5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and exhibits broad taxonomic distribution spanning mammals, insects, nematodes, and even plants like Catharanthus roseus. The penultimate step involves serotonin N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.87), also termed aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase, which acetylates serotonin to form N-acetylserotonin using acetyl-CoA as the acetyl donor; this enzyme controls the circadian rhythm of melatonin production and is present in vertebrates including humans, rodents, sheep, chickens, and cattle, as well as in invertebrates like Drosophila, and notably in plants such as Arabidopsis and rice where it localizes to chloroplasts. The final step is catalyzed by acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.4), also known as hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase, which transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to N-acetylserotonin producing melatonin and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine; this enzyme is found in mammals (humans, rodents, primates, bovines), birds, and plants including Arabidopsis and rice with multiple isoforms. The chemical intermediates thus progress from L-tryptophan → 5-hydroxytryptophan → serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) → N-acetylserotonin → melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine), with an alternative minor pathway involving acetylation before methylation through 5-methoxytryptamine. Plant species exhibit a distinctive feature with chloroplast-localized enzymes and multiple gene copies, suggesting independent evolutionary origins or specialized regulatory mechanisms for phytomelatonin synthesis involved in stress responses and growth regulation.",42,3140,0.33514975,0.342779,"mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__ols__searchClasses, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",3,4,4,4,15,"Covers the four-step pathway and key enzymes (AANAT, ASMT) with chemical intermediates.

question_005,choice,"Among the following kinase groups — AGC, CAMK, CMGC, and TK — which has the greatest number of human protein targets with experimentally determined X-ray crystal structures deposited in the PDB?

Choose one of the following options:
  - AGC
  - CAMK
  - CMGC
  - TK","TK (tyrosine kinases) has the greatest number of human protein targets with
PDB X-ray crystal structures, with 2,280 structures across 80 ChEMBL-classified
human targets. CMGC ranks second (1,539 structures, 58 targets), followed by
CAMK (734 structures, 65 targets) and AGC (422 structures, 59 targets).

TK dominates structural coverage because tyrosine kinases are the primary targets
in cancer drug discovery. The EGFR family alone (EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4) accounts
for hundreds of entries; BCR-ABL1 (P00519) has over 200 structures due to
imatinib-resistance studies; VEGFR2/KDR (P35968), ALK (Q9UM73), c-MET (P08581),
RET (P07949), FGFR1-4, and the SRC family kinases each contribute dozens to
hundreds of structures. The pharmaceutical industry's intense focus on TK
inhibitors for oncology has driven an outsized crystallographic effort relative
to the number of targets.

CMGC ranks second because it includes intensively studied targets: CDK2 (P24941)
alone has over 400 PDB structures from fragment-based and structure-based drug
design campaigns; CDK4/6 (cyclin-dependent kinases), CDK8, CDK9, MAPK1/ERK2
(P28482), MAPK14/p38α (Q16539), GSK3B (P49841), and DYRK1A (Q13627) are all
major drug targets with large structural datasets.

CAMK ranks third despite having the most targets (65) among the four groups,
because many CAMK members (e.g., CaM kinases, DAPK, CHK1, CHK2) are less
pharmacologically tractable or have been structurally solved fewer times.

AGC ranks last (422 structures) despite its prominent members (AKT1/2/3, PKCα,
PKA, RSK1-4, S6K1) because several AGC kinases proved challenging for structural
biology due to flexibility or membrane association, and the group has fewer
members overall.

A note on cross-group overlap: 70 PDB structures (1.4%) contain proteins with
dual classification in ChEMBL (6 proteins annotated as both AGC and CAMK). These
structures are counted in both groups' totals. This overlap does not affect the
answer — TK leads CMGC by 741 structures, far exceeding the 70-structure overlap.
",True,7.31,"The TK (tyrosine kinase) group has the greatest number of human protein targets with experimentally determined X-ray crystal structures deposited in the PDB among these four kinase groups.

The human kinome contains approximately 90 tyrosine kinases (including both receptor and non-receptor TKs), and a very high proportion of these have been crystallized, often in multiple states and with various inhibitors. Kinases like EGFR, ABL, SRC, JAK family members, and numerous receptor tyrosine kinases have dozens to hundreds of PDB entries each. In contrast, while AGC (containing about 60 kinases), CAMK (about 74 kinases), and CMGC (about 61 kinases) groups also have substantial structural coverage, their therapeutic focus has been somewhat less intensive historically, resulting in fewer total structures despite containing similar or greater numbers of individual kinases.

From 185 human metalloproteases (reviewed SwissProt entries), 92 are registered as ChEMBL single-protein drug targets, and 91 have at least one experimental PDB structure cross-referenced in UniProt. The intersection — proteins that are both ChEMBL drug targets and structurally characterized — is 69, representing 75% structural coverage of the metalloprotease drug target space. This high coverage reflects the pharmaceutical importance of metalloproteases, particularly matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), ADAMs, and aminopeptidases, which are extensively pursued for cancer, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease.

However, while ChEMBL does contain an entry for Spatacsin (CHEMBL6067204), this represents a single protein target record without any associated bioactivity data or drug molecules, which means it does not qualify as a bona fide drug target in the pharmaceutical sense that ChEMBL typically catalogs—targets with screened compounds or known drug interactions.

These organisms exhibit varying oxygen tolerances, classified as obligate anaerobes that cannot survive oxygen exposure (such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species), aerotolerant anaerobes that survive but do not utilize oxygen (like some Propionibacterium species), and facultative anaerobes that can grow with or without oxygen (including certain Actinomyces species). Culture conditions typically require specialized anaerobic chambers, jars with oxygen-scavenging systems, or pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized (PRAS) media, maintained at 35-37°C for mesophilic species. Growth media are supplemented with reducing agents such as cysteine, thioglycolate, or dithiothreitol to maintain low redox potentials (typically -150 to -300 mV), and may include hemin and vitamin K for fastidious species. Atmosphere composition usually contains 80-90% nitrogen, 5-10% hydrogen, and 5-10% carbon dioxide, with oxygen levels maintained below 0.5%.

Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, CHEMBL215) has the most ChEMBL mechanism records of any pathway enzyme, with eight drugs documented as inhibitors, including zileuton (phase 4), the only FDA-approved drug specifically indicated for asthma that acts by reversibly inhibiting this rate-limiting step in leukotriene synthesis, as well as five other phase-4 anti-inflammatory agents (mesalamine, sulfasalazine, balsalazide disodium, olsalazine sodium, meclofenamate sodium) and two phase-2 clinical candidates (PF-4191834, atreleuton). The 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP/FLAP, CHEMBL4550) is the most clinically active target, with three distinct phase-3 clinical inhibitors — fiboflapon, fiboflapon sodium, and veliflapon — all documented as INHIBITOR mechanisms. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H, CHEMBL4618), which converts LTA4 to the potent chemoattractant LTB4, is targeted by acebilustat at phase 2. The multidrug resistance-associated protein ABCC1/MRP1 (CHEMBL3004), which exports LTC4 across the cell membrane as part of the pathway, is targeted by the phase-2 multidrug resistance modulator biricodar. MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2, CHEMBL2208), which activates ALOX5 via phosphorylation, is targeted at phase 1 by AT-13148, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor. Three pathway enzymes — arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1), and leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) — lack ChEMBL mechanism records despite participating in the pathway, reflecting their lower prioritisation as drug targets in clinical development programmes.

ALOX5 catalyzes the first committed step in leukotriene synthesis by converting arachidonic acid to leukotriene A4 and is targeted by inhibitors such as zileuton, which is approved for asthma treatment. ALOX5AP is an essential cofactor that presents arachidonic acid to ALOX5 and is targeted by compounds like MK-591 and other investigational agents. LTA4H converts leukotriene A4 to leukotriene B4, a potent chemoattractant, and has been pursued as a drug target for inflammatory conditions with various inhibitors documented in ChEMBL. LTC4S conjugates leukotriene A4 with glutathione to form leukotriene C4, the precursor of cysteinyl leukotrienes, and selective inhibitors have been developed and characterized in the database.

- ALOX15: converts LTA4 to EXA4 (eoxin pathway)
- ALOX12: oxidises LTA4 to lipoxins
- LTC4S: converts LTA4 to LTC4 and EXA4 to EXC4
- LTA4H: hydrolyzes LTA4 to LTB4

Three human enzymes with catalytic roles in leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis are documented drug targets in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records: polyunsaturated fatty acid 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, encoded by ALOX5 gene), polyunsaturated fatty acid lipoxygenase ALOX12 (encoded by ALOX12 gene), and leukotriene A-4 hydrolase (LTA4H, encoded by LTA4H gene). ALOX5 catalyzes the dehydration of 5S-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid to leukotriene A4 and has eight documented mechanism-of-action records in ChEMBL as an inhibitor target, including six approved drugs (zileuton, mesalamine, sulfasalazine, balsalazide disodium, meclofenamate sodium, and olsalazine sodium) and two clinical-stage compounds.

This substantially exceeds connective tissue disorder (134 TopicalDescriptors), autoimmune disease (61 TopicalDescriptors), and rheumatic disorder (39 TopicalDescriptors). The counts reflect confirmed joins with the MeSH RDF graph restricted to meshv:TopicalDescriptor entries (i.e., canonical MeSH headings used for indexing); MONDO cross-references to MeSH supplementary concept records (MESH:C...) are excluded. The four categories are not mutually exclusive: immune system disorder is the broadest and contains the other three as subcategories, so their diseases are counted within it as well — the sum across categories (482) exceeds the 346 unique diseases with TopicalDescriptor mappings due to this intentional overlap in the ontology hierarchy. The higher absolute count for immune system disorder reflects its greater scope rather than a higher per-disease mapping rate, since autoimmune disease and rheumatic disorder actually have proportionally good coverage relative to their size.
",True,8.2,"The correct answer is **connective tissue disorder**.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is classified under multiple parent disease categories in medical ontologies, including immune system disorders, autoimmune diseases, connective tissue disorders, and rheumatic disorders. Among these hierarchical classifications, connective tissue disorders represent a more specific disease grouping that encompasses a well-defined set of conditions with established MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) classifications. Connective tissue disorders include conditions like SLE itself, systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, mixed connective tissue disease, and Sjögren's syndrome, all of which have confirmed MeSH TopicalDescriptor mappings due to their historical classification as a cohesive disease group with shared pathological features affecting connective tissues throughout the body. While the broader categories like immune system disorders and autoimmune diseases contain more total diseases, the connective tissue disorder category represents a more tightly curated collection where most member diseases have well-established MeSH mappings, making it the parent category with the highest proportion of diseases with confirmed MeSH TopicalDescriptor assignments.",242,251,0.004491,True,125.18,"**Immune system disorder**

Filtering for PubChem compounds (those with URIs starting with ""http://rdf.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/compound/"") that are typed by any of these 64 ChEBI classes yields 24 distinct compounds. These include central pathway intermediates such as protoporphyrinogen IX, Mg-protoporphyrin IX, and various chlorophyllide derivatives, as well as cofactors like NADPH, ATP, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The substantially smaller number of PubChem entries relative to ChEBI classes reflects the fact that many highly specific tetrapyrrole intermediates and bacteriochlorophyll precursors, though well-defined in ChEBI, do not yet have curated entries in PubChem.

The database records 286 total glycosylation site entries for decorin, reflecting the multiple glycan structures (glycoforms) annotated at individual positions — position 211 alone carries 132 distinct glycoform entries and position 262 carries 121, indicating extensive N-glycan microheterogeneity at these asparagine residues. The site at position 34 corresponds to the canonical glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin/dermatan sulfate) attachment serine characteristic of the proteoglycan core protein. This rich glycosylation complexity is consistent with decorin's biological roles in extracellular matrix organization, collagen fibrillogenesis, and TGF-β sequestration, where the glycan chains modulate protein–protein interactions and tissue hydration.

Decorin contains a single glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain attachment site, specifically for chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate, which is attached to a serine residue near the N-terminus of the protein core. Additionally, decorin possesses N-linked glycosylation sites on asparagine residues within its leucine-rich repeat domain.

The taxonomic distribution reveals that hormone proteins are predominantly found in mammals, with Mus musculus (138 proteins), Homo sapiens (134 proteins), and Rattus norvegicus (123 proteins) representing the top three species. Significant representation is also observed in other vertebrates (83 proteins in Bos taurus, 67 in Sus scrofa), insects (39 in Drosophila melanogaster, 37 in Bombyx mori), and notably in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (57 proteins), reflecting the evolutionary conservation and diversification of hormonal signaling systems across eukaryotes.

question_015,summary,"Characterize the reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 across three dimensions: their GO-annotated functional module assignments (capsid, baseplate, and tail components); any enzymatic activities encoded among these otherwise structural late proteins; and their experimental structural coverage, including the relative proportions of cryo-electron microscopy versus X-ray crystallography depositions.","The 25 reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4, all annotated with KW-0426, collectively encode the phage's iconic contractile tail-injection nanomachine and partition into four major GO-defined structural modules: the capsid (2 proteins: CAPSH/major capsid protein, CAPSP/capsid vertex), the baseplate (11 proteins: the ten wedge and hub assembly proteins gp7, gp10, gp25, gp27, gp48, gp53, gp54, gp26, gp28, gp51, plus the pre-baseplate central spike gp5), the tail tube and completion system (4 proteins: gp19 tube, tail tube terminator, tape-measure protein, gp15 tail completion protein), and the tail fibers (5 proteins: short fiber gp12, three long-fiber subunits gp35/gp36/gp37, and the long-fiber proximal subunit), with the structural collar protein fibritin (WAC) and two DNA helicase isoforms (uvsW and uvsW1) completing the set. Enzymatically, two late proteins break the ""purely structural"" expectation: gp5 (NEEDL_BPT4) bears lysozyme activity (GO:0003796) that hydrolyzes peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall to puncture the host envelope during injection, while the uvsW DNA helicases (GO:0043138, 3'-5' DNA helicase activity) drive late-phase recombination and repair, a function unusual for proteins expressed after DNA replication has begun. Of the 25 proteins, 17 (68%) are structurally characterized in PDB via at least one entry, yielding 149 distinct structures (103 by cryo-electron microscopy, 44 by X-ray crystallography, 2 by solution NMR); because T4 assemblies are large multi-subunit complexes—the baseplate alone contains 11 late proteins—the same PDB entry frequently references multiple T4 proteins, producing 182 total protein-to-entry attributions for 149 distinct structures (33 attribution counts arise from co-occurrence in assemblies). The striking dominance of cryo-EM (69% of entries) reflects the field's shift toward studying intact viral assemblies: fibritin alone accounts for 104 of these entries due to its adoption as an engineering scaffold, while the gp5 spike (18 entries) and major capsid protein (9 entries) follow; the eight structurally uncharacterized proteins—most notably the three baseplate hub proteins gp26, gp28, and gp51, the two long tail-fiber subunits gp35 and gp36, and the two uvsW helicase isoforms—represent current frontiers in T4 structural biology.
",True,12.5,"The late proteins of bacteriophage T4 are organized into three major structural modules: the capsid (including major head protein gp23, vertex protein gp24, and portal protein gp20), the tail tube and sheath (comprised of gp19 and gp18 respectively, along with tail terminator proteins), and the elaborate baseplate complex (containing at least 15 different gene products including gp5-gp12, gp25, gp27, gp29, gp48, gp53, and gp54). Despite their predominantly structural roles, several late proteins possess enzymatic activities essential for infection: gp5 carries a lysozyme domain at its C-terminus that degrades peptidoglycan during infection, baseplate hub protein gp27 exhibits ATPase activity involved in baseplate assembly, and the tail fibers (gp34, gp35, gp36, gp37) contain endorhamnosidase domains for host cell wall binding and degradation. Experimental structural coverage of T4 late proteins reflects the historical evolution of structural biology methods, with early crystal structures solved for individual components like gp23 (major capsid protein), gp24, gp5 C-terminal domain, and several baseplate proteins including gp10, gp11, and portions of tail fiber proteins. However, the field has been revolutionized by cryo-electron microscopy, which now dominates structural depositions due to its capacity to resolve large macromolecular assemblies in near-native states; cryo-EM structures include the complete capsid at atomic or near-atomic resolution, the extended tail assembly showing the helical arrangement of gp19 and gp18, and increasingly detailed views of the intricate baseplate in both pre- and post-infection conformational states, representing approximately 70-80% of recent structural depositions compared to 20-30% from X-ray crystallography.",383,427,0.007554,True,92.75,"The reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 exhibit clear functional modularity with 31 proteins distributed across three major virion compartments: two capsid proteins (gp23 major capsid protein and gp24 vertex protein) plus two decoration proteins (Hoc and Soc), 14 baseplate components (wedge proteins gp6-11, gp25, gp53; hub proteins gp26, gp28, gp51; central spike proteins gp5 and gp27; and junction proteins gp48, gp54), and seven tail components (tube protein gp19, sheath protein gp18, portal protein gp20, tube terminator gp3, tail completion protein gp15, tape measure protein gp29, and four long-tail fiber proteins gp34-37) alongside one short-tail fiber protein gp12 and the collar protein fibritin.

This order, which includes well-studied nitrogen-fixing alpha-proteobacteria such as Rhizobium phaseoli (6 genes), Rhodopseudomonas palustris (4 genes), and Xanthobacter autotrophicus (4 genes), is the predominant source of characterized nitrogenase genes in current genomic databases, reflecting decades of genome sequencing focused on agriculturally important symbiotic and free-living diazotrophs. Eubacteriales (formerly Clostridiales) ranks second with 19 nifH/nifD genes from 8 organisms, including Clostridium pasteurianum DSM 525 (7 genes) as the dominant contributor, alongside other anaerobic nitrogen fixers such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum (3 genes) and Clostridium beijerinckii (2 genes). Burkholderiales has 11 genes from 5 organisms including the endophyte Herbaspirillum seropedicae, while Pseudomonadales has only 7 genes from 2 organisms, notably Azotobacter chroococcum. The dominance of Hyphomicrobiales (66 genes, 64% of the 103 genes in these four orders) reflects the extensive genome sequencing of alpha-proteobacterial diazotrophs and the multiple nifH/nifD paralogs retained in some of these organisms. Across the full NCBI Gene database, 375 nifH/nifD genes span 174 organisms, demonstrating that nitrogen fixation capability is phylogenetically scattered well beyond these four orders, including in diverse Archaea (e.g., Methanocaldococcus) and sulfate-reducing bacteria.

While Hyphomicrobiales also contains significant nitrogen-fixing capacity through genera like Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Sinorhizobium, Burkholderiales appears to have greater representation in terms of absolute gene counts in the database. Pseudomonadales has limited nitrogen-fixing capability, with only certain Azotobacter and Azomonas species possessing functional nif genes.

question_017,yes_no,Does Anabaena sp. DSM 101043 grow in nitrogen-free BG11- medium?,"Yes, Anabaena sp. DSM 101043 (BacDive ID 131407) is documented to grow in Cyanobacteria Medium BG11-, which is a nitrogen-free medium used to induce heterocyst formation in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. A MediaDive query confirmed zero nitrogen-containing ingredients (no nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, or urea) in BG11-, establishing that the strain grows without any external fixed-nitrogen source. BG11- medium lacks fixed nitrogen sources, requiring nitrogen-fixing strains like Anabaena to form specialized heterocyst cells for atmospheric nitrogen fixation. This psychrophilic strain isolated from sediment can fix atmospheric nitrogen through the nitrogenase enzyme complex housed within heterocysts, specialized anaerobic cells that protect oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase from photosynthetic oxygen production. The cross-database integration between BacDive (strain characterization) and MediaDive (validated cultivation protocols) confirms this nitrogen-independent growth capability.
",True,7.11,"Anabaena sp. DSM 101043, like other members of the genus Anabaena, is a filamentous cyanobacterium capable of nitrogen fixation and can grow in nitrogen-free BG11⁰ medium (also written as BG11-). This growth capability is enabled by the organism's ability to form specialized cells called heterocysts, which are the sites of nitrogen fixation where the enzyme nitrogenase converts atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) into ammonia that can be utilized for cellular metabolism. When cultured in nitrogen-free medium, Anabaena strains differentiate heterocysts along their filaments at regular intervals, typically comprising 5-10% of the cells in the filament. The BG11⁰ medium is specifically formulated as the standard BG11 medium but without combined nitrogen sources (such as nitrate or ammonium), making it the preferred medium for studying nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and for maintaining cultures that rely on atmospheric nitrogen fixation.

When distributed across eight GO cellular component subcategories using structured ontology IRIs, 49 of these proteins are annotated to the general proteasome complex (GO:0000502), while the 20S core complex (GO:0005839) accounts for 18 proteins, the accessory complex (GO:0022624) for 16, the core beta-subunit complex (GO:0019774) for 11, the regulatory particle base subcomplex (GO:0008540) for 9, the lid subcomplex (GO:0008541) for 8, the alpha-subunit complex (GO:0019773) for 8, and the 19S regulatory particle (GO:0005838) for 7. The sum of these category counts reaches 126 annotations for 52 uniquely annotated proteins (arithmetic verification: 126 > 52 = valid overlap), reflecting extensive multi-subcomplex co-annotation — for example, a beta subunit is simultaneously annotated to the general proteasome complex, the 20S core, and the beta-subunit complex. Four proteins lack the general GO:0000502 annotation entirely: PSMF1 (PI31 inhibitor), PSME4 (PA200 activator), PSB11 (inducible beta-11), and PSMA8 (testis-specific alpha-8). Three of them (PSMF1, PSB11, PSMA8) still appear in subcomplex categories (GO:0005839, GO:0019774, GO:0019773 respectively), while PSME4 carries none of the eight GO subcomplex annotations, consistent with its role as an externally docking activator rather than a structural subunit. Cross-referencing with ChEMBL reveals that 22 of the 53 proteins (41.5%) are registered as human single-protein drug targets, with all eight canonical beta subunits included — consistent with the clinical use of proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib that target the beta5 catalytic subunit (PSMB5).

In this reaction, two molecules of the lumazine intermediate undergo a dismutation: one is oxidized to release the four-carbon fragment that becomes the dimethylbenzene ring of riboflavin, while the other is reduced back to 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil, an earlier precursor in the riboflavin pathway. The reaction is chemically balanced, Approved in Rhea, and annotated with GO:0004746 (riboflavin synthase activity). The pteridine scaffold of the lumazine substrate is thus the direct biosynthetic precursor to the isoalloxazine ring system of riboflavin (vitamin B2).
",True,7.55,"6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine is classified in PubChem as a pteridine (CHEBI:17601), as it contains the characteristic pteridine bicyclic ring system consisting of fused pyrimidine and pyrazine rings. This compound is indeed documented as a substrate in approved Rhea reactions catalyzed by riboflavin synthase (EC 2.5.1.9). Specifically, riboflavin synthase catalyzes the dismutation reaction in which two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine are converted into one molecule of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and one molecule of 5-amino-6-(1-D-ribitylamino)uracil. This reaction represents the final step in riboflavin biosynthesis and involves the transfer of a four-carbon unit from one lumazine molecule to another.

This repertoire encompasses the full biochemical breadth of these enzymes beyond their nicotinate-specific roles: the pathway itself covers the Preiss-Handler route (nicotinate → NaMN → deamido-NAD+ → NAD+ via NAPRT, NMNAT1-3, and NADSYN1), the NAD+ salvage route (nicotinamide → NMN → NAD+ via NAMPT and NMNATs), and NAD+ consumption and recycling steps (CD38/BST1 glycohydrolases, NNMT methyltransferase, NT5E nucleotidase). The per-enzyme Rhea contribution varies widely: the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SLC5A8 (Q8N695) links to 14 approved reactions reflecting its broad substrate range for short-chain carboxylates including nicotinate, while NT5E/CD73 (P21589) contributes 10 reactions covering all its nucleoside monophosphate substrates. CD38 (P28907) accounts for 6 reactions including NAD+ glycohydrolase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, and cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase activities. The 58-reaction total from 22 enzymes (68 protein-reaction pairs) reflects 10 shared reactions catalysed by multiple enzyme paralogues — for instance, the core NAD+ glycohydrolase reaction (Rhea:16301) is shared by both CD38 and BST1/CD157. In contrast, NAMPT, NADK, NAPRT, QPRT, and NNMT each contribute a single Rhea reaction reflecting their narrow substrate specificity, while NMNAT1 (Q9HAN9) contributes 2 approved reactions — covering both NMN (Rhea:21360) and NaMN (Rhea:22860) as substrates — consistent with its dual role in both the salvage and Preiss-Handler de novo routes to NAD+.

In the MeSH hierarchy, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (D020788) is classified simultaneously under congenital and hereditary ciliopathies (tree C16.131.077.245.125 and C16.320.184.125), retinitis pigmentosa within eye diseases (C11.270.684.624), and hypothalamic diseases (C10.228.140.617.200), reflecting the multi-system pathology of this ciliopathy. Together the eight genes harbor 7,800 distinct current ClinVar variants; BBS9 (1,283 variants) and BBS2 (1,258) carry the heaviest burdens, followed by BBS1 (1,193), BBS10 (1,007), BBS4 (900), BBS12 (868), BBS7 (849), and BBS5 (465, the lightest burden). By variant type, single nucleotide variants overwhelmingly dominate at 6,468 (83%), followed by deletions (666; 8.5%) and duplications (274; 3.5%). For clinical significance across all eight genes, the largest category is likely benign (2,808 variants), followed by variants of uncertain significance at 2,759, while pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and combined pathogenic/likely pathogenic entries total 1,638; 23 variants are counted in two BBS genes simultaneously, reflecting structural variants on chromosome 4 that overlap both BBS7 and BBS12.

The remaining 19 genera either lack BacDive oxygen tolerance records entirely (Metallosphaera, Saccharolobus, Sulfolobus, and Synechocystis have no OT records; these are all aerobic or oxygenic photosynthetic organisms) or have mixed oxygen tolerance records that include at least one non-anaerobic strain (Acidianus has both aerobe and anaerobe strains reflecting its capacity for either aerobic sulfur oxidation or anaerobic sulfur reduction; Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Geobacillus, Lysinibacillus, Caulobacter, Deinococcus, and Niallia are predominantly aerobic or facultative with only a minority of anaerobic isolates; Aeromonas, Campylobacter, Lactobacillus, and Levilactobacillus span multiple oxygen tolerance categories; Haloarcula, Halobacterium, and Haloferax are aerobic halophilic archaea). The seven exclusively anaerobic genera span two phyla: five are methanogenic archaea from Euryarchaeota (Methanosarcina, Methanococcus, Methanocaldococcus, Methanothermus, Methanothermococcus) that use S-layers as their sole cell-wall component in place of peptidoglycan, and two are anaerobic thermophilic bacteria from Firmicutes (Acetivibrio, a cellulose-degrading clostridial relative; Thermoanaerobacter, a fermentative thermophile exploiting reduced sugar substrates at 50–78 °C). Across both lineages, the crystalline S-layer provides mechanical rigidity and selective permeability under the reductive, often high-temperature conditions of their ecological niches — anoxic sediments, rumen contents, hydrothermal vents, and deep-sea anaerobic environments — where peptidoglycan-based or outer-membrane-based cell walls would be thermodynamically or structurally disadvantaged.

The most frequently resistant bacterial species are Escherichia coli (853 resistant isolates), Shigella sonnei (729), Salmonella enterica (334), Klebsiella pneumoniae (220), and Shigella flexneri (150); Staphylococcus aureus (33) and Enterococcus faecium also contribute. Taxonomically, the dominant resistant organisms—E. coli, Shigella, Klebsiella, and Salmonella—all belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria, whereas Staphylococcus aureus (family Staphylococcaceae) and Enterococcus faecium (family Enterococcaceae) represent Firmicutes exceptions. Genotypically, AMRportal contains 25,236 TRIMETHOPRIM-class resistance features; the predominant gene family is dhfrI with multiple allelic variants (dhfrI_1: 3,855; dhfrI_2: 3,851; dhfrI: 2,784; dhfrI_3–7: additional records totaling ~11,583), followed by folA variants (~1,873), dfrD variants (~1,032), and dfrA variants (~520)—all encoding dihydrofolate reductase (NCBI Gene: folA described as ""dihydrofolate reductase""; dfrA as ""dihydrofolate reductase""), the enzyme target of trimethoprim that inhibits bacterial tetrahydrofolate synthesis. Among the 2,073 geographically annotated resistant isolates, Europe shows the highest burden (823), followed by Oceania (698), Asia (392), Africa (118), and the Americas (42), a distribution that reflects global surveillance intensity and the concentration of large-scale clinical monitoring programs in Europe and Australasia.
",True,10.79,"Trimethoprim resistance is most prevalent among Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella species, followed by other Gram-negative families including Pseudomonadaceae (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Acinetobacter species, with notable resistance also observed in Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus species. The predominant resistance mechanisms involve the dfr (dihydrofolate reductase) gene family, which encodes alternative DHFR enzymes with reduced trimethoprim binding affinity; major variants include dfrA genes (over 30 subtypes, common in Enterobacteriaceae), dfrB genes (found in Gram-positive bacteria), and dfrG genes, all of which maintain folate biosynthesis function while conferring insensitivity to trimethoprim inhibition. Geographic distribution shows widespread dissemination globally, with particularly high prevalence in regions with intensive antibiotic use: Asian countries (notably India, China, and Southeast Asia) report resistance rates exceeding 50-70% in E. coli urinary isolates, sub-Saharan Africa shows increasing resistance particularly in enteric pathogens, Europe displays variable rates (20-50%) with higher levels in Southern and Eastern regions, North America reports moderate resistance (30-40% in community-acquired E. coli), and South America shows elevated rates in several countries.

Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae dominate as the most phenotypically resistant species, both belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, with resistance rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ranging from 31-96% across different regions and sample types, followed by Salmonella species (also Enterobacteriaceae), Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcaceae), Vibrio cholerae (Vibrionaceae), and emerging resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae (Streptococcaceae) and Riemerella anatipestifer (Flavobacteriaceae). The predominant resistance mechanism involves the dfr (dihydrofolate reductase) gene family, which encodes trimethoprim-resistant variants of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, the molecular target of trimethoprim in the folate synthesis pathway; these dfr genes, including numerous alleles such as dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA12, dfrA15, dfrA34, and dfrA49, confer resistance by producing altered forms of dihydrofolate reductase with reduced trimethoprim binding affinity, thereby maintaining bacterial folate metabolism even in the presence of the drug. These resistance genes are frequently located on mobile genetic elements including class 1 integrons (often in cassettes combining dfr with aminoglycoside resistance genes like aadA), IncF-type plasmids, IncR plasmids, and insertion sequences such as ISCR1, facilitating horizontal transfer between bacterial species and geographic spread.

question_035,choice,"Among X-RAY DIFFRACTION, SOLUTION NMR, and ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, which experimental technique accounts for the greatest number of distinct three-dimensional structure entries for reviewed human serine proteases?

Choose one of the following options:
  - X-RAY DIFFRACTION
  - SOLUTION NMR
  - ELECTRON MICROSCOPY","X-RAY DIFFRACTION accounts for the greatest number of distinct structural entries for reviewed human serine proteases, with 1,880 PDB entries, vastly outnumbering ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (137 entries) and SOLUTION NMR (37 entries). This distribution was determined by cross-referencing the 141 reviewed human serine protease sequences from UniProt Swiss-Prot (keyword KW-0720, Homo sapiens) against all PDB entries via the UniProt accession links in the structure database. The total of 2,055 unique PDB entries spans five experimental techniques; two minor methods — ELECTRON CRYSTALLOGRAPHY (1 entry) and NEUTRON DIFFRACTION (1 entry) — also appear. The 2,056 method-level annotations for 2,055 unique entries indicate that one entry was deposited under two experimental methods (valid overlap). The overwhelming dominance of X-ray crystallography (91.5% of entries) reflects the historical tractability of serine proteases for crystal formation: their well-defined active-site geometry, availability of high-affinity inhibitor co-crystals, and pharmaceutical relevance as drug targets have driven decades of intensive crystallographic campaigns. Electron microscopy is still underrepresented for this family because most clinically relevant serine proteases are monomeric enzymes with molecular weights below ~100 kDa, at the lower end of optimal cryo-EM resolution, whereas solution NMR captures only the smaller members of the family.
",True,7.33,"**X-RAY DIFFRACTION** is the correct answer.

X-ray diffraction (X-ray crystallography) accounts for the vast majority of three-dimensional structure entries for reviewed human serine proteases in the Protein Data Bank. This dominance reflects both historical precedence and technical advantages: X-ray crystallography has been the primary method for protein structure determination since the mid-20th century and is particularly well-suited for serine proteases, which are typically small to medium-sized globular proteins (20-35 kDa) that can be readily crystallized. Many human serine proteases, including thrombin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and various coagulation factors, have been extensively studied by X-ray crystallography, often with multiple structures deposited showing different ligand complexes, activation states, or mutants. Solution NMR, while valuable for studying protein dynamics and smaller proteins, is less commonly used for complete structure determination of serine proteases due to size limitations and lower throughput. Electron microscopy, particularly cryo-EM, has only recently become widely applicable to proteins in this size range and remains far less common for serine protease structure determination compared to the thousands of X-ray crystal structures available.",256,275,0.004893,True,263.02,"Perfect!

In MedGen's MGREL database, this concept has 47 documented ""manifestation_of"" relationships, one of which links it to Cholecystitis (MedGen:C0008325). While metachromatic leukodystrophy is primarily known for progressive neurological manifestations — including peripheral demyelination, cerebellar ataxia, and intellectual disability — gallbladder involvement, including Cholecystitis and gallbladder dysfunction, is documented in the structured clinical data. This reflects the systemic nature of sulfatide accumulation in MLD: ARSA normally degrades sulfatides in lysosomes throughout the body, and excess sulfatide deposits in gallbladder epithelial cells and bile ducts can lead to cholecystitis and gallbladder polyps. This association is catalogued in MedGen's clinical knowledge graph but is not prominent in the standard biomedical literature, making it non-trivially verifiable without querying current structured databases.

question_038,choice,"Among the five Mus musculus limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs Capn3, Dysf, Lmna, Ano5, and Plec, which has the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts in Ensembl GRCm39?

Choose one of the following options:
  - Capn3
  - Dysf
  - Lmna
  - Ano5
  - Plec","Among the five Mus musculus limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs compared, Plec (encoding plectin, the mouse ortholog of the human LGMD2Q gene PLEC) has by far the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts in Ensembl GRCm39 with 21 isoforms, followed by Dysf (dysferlin, LGMD2B ortholog) with 12, Capn3 (calpain 3, LGMD2A ortholog) with 10, Lmna (lamin A, LGMD1B ortholog) with 4, and Ano5 (anoctamin 5, LGMD2L ortholog) with 3. Plec's exceptional transcript diversity reflects its unique genomic architecture: the mouse Plec gene encodes at least 11 alternative first exons (1a–1j and a common exon 2) that each splice into a shared downstream coding region, producing tissue-specific isoforms directed to distinct subcellular compartments — for example, isoform 1a targets hemidesmosomes in epithelia while isoform 1f localises to costameres and Z-discs in striated muscle. Dysf's 12 isoforms reflect alternative splicing of its tandem C2 domain array, relevant to its role in membrane repair at the sarcolemma. Capn3's 10 isoforms include the muscle-specific p94 form and lens isoform Lp82 arising from alternative promoter usage. By contrast, Lmna (4 isoforms, primarily lamin A and lamin C from alternative splicing at exon 10) and Ano5 (3 isoforms) are architecturally simpler. The striking isoform count difference between Plec and Ano5 (21 vs. 3) therefore does not reflect clinical severity but rather the mechanistic complexity of their membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding roles versus channel/lipid scramblase functions.
",True,7.43,"The correct answer is **Plec**.

Plec (plectin) has the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts among these five limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs in Ensembl GRCm39. Plectin is a large cytolinker protein that exhibits extensive alternative splicing, resulting in numerous tissue-specific and functionally distinct isoforms. The gene spans a substantial genomic region and contains multiple alternative first exons that can be combined with common downstream exons, generating a diverse repertoire of protein-coding transcripts. This high degree of alternative splicing reflects plectin's role as a versatile cytoskeletal linker protein that must interact with various binding partners in different cellular contexts and tissue types. In contrast, while genes like Dysf and Capn3 also undergo alternative splicing, they typically produce fewer protein-coding transcript variants. Lmna produces several important isoforms (including lamin A and lamin C), and Ano5 has relatively limited transcript diversity, but neither approaches the transcript complexity observed for Plec in the mouse genome annotation.",284,247,0.004557,True,22.35,"**Plec**

SCN5A encodes the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 and is the primary causal gene for Brugada syndrome, responsible for 15–30% of cases through loss-of-function variants; its ChEMBL entry reflects its central role as a drug target for antiarrhythmic compounds and as a cardiac safety liability. The potassium channels KCNH2 (hERG) and KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) are prominent ChEMBL targets because inhibition of hERG is a major mechanism of drug-induced QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. CACNA1C encodes the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2, a target for dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. RYR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) is targeted by flecainide and other agents used in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, a related channelopathy with substantial overlap in the research literature. The complete overlap between the high-frequency co-annotation set and ChEMBL pharmacological targets reflects the ion-channel-centric pathophysiology of Brugada syndrome and the translational significance of these genes in cardiac drug development and safety pharmacology.

Of the eleven human siglec-family glycoproteins represented in GlyCosmos (SIGLEC5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16), these four are the only members for which site-resolved glycoproteomic mass spectrometry data have been curated: SIGLEC5 has 34 annotated glycosylation sites with 33 associated glycan structures (GlyConnect entry 568), SIGLEC7 has 32 sites with 31 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 569), SIGLEC8 has 28 sites with 27 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 570), and SIGLEC14 has 14 sites with 9 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 1978). The remaining seven siglecs (SIGLEC6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16) are recorded in GlyCosmos with glycosylation site predictions from GlyGen but lack curated per-site glycan composition data. Three of the four characterized siglecs (SIGLEC5, 7, 8) are CD33-related inhibitory receptors carrying cytoplasmic ITIMs, while SIGLEC14 is an activating receptor paired with DAP12; all four are expressed primarily on myeloid or NK cells and play roles in immune tolerance, allergy regulation, and innate immune modulation. Dense N-glycosylation of siglec ectodomains is biologically significant because the glycan shield can occlude the V-set sialic acid-binding domain, favoring cis-ligand masking on the cell surface over trans-ligand engagement, and modulating receptor clustering and signaling thresholds.

question_045,summary,"What are the structural characteristics of 3-demethylubiquinones as intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis, and how are they enzymatically converted to ubiquinones?","3-Demethylubiquinones are penultimate intermediates in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway that differ from their mature ubiquinone counterparts by a single structural feature: a free hydroxyl group (-OH) at ring position 3 instead of the methoxyl group (-OCH3) found in ubiquinones, classifying them ontologically as monohydroxy-1,4-benzoquinones within the broader ubiquinone family. This single substituent difference translates to a molecular mass difference of approximately 14 Da for each chain-length variant; for example, 3-demethylubiquinone-9 has the molecular formula C53H80O4 with a molecular weight of 781.2 Da (compared to 795.2 Da for ubiquinone-9), while 3-demethylubiquinone-10 has the formula C58H88O4 with a molecular weight of 849.3 Da (compared to 863.3 Da for coenzyme Q10). Their conversion to ubiquinones is catalyzed by SAM-dependent O-methyltransferases in a reaction where S-adenosyl-L-methionine donates a methyl group to the hydroxyl at position 3, yielding the corresponding ubiquinol (reduced) or ubiquinone (oxidized) product along with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. The Rhea database catalogues 7 approved reactions of this type, comprising 2 generic reactions covering the entire class of 3-demethylubiquinone and 3-demethylubiquinol species and 5 chain-length-specific reactions for the n=6, n=7, n=8, n=9, and n=10 polyprenyl variants that predominate across different organisms.
",True,10.29,"3-Demethylubiquinones are structural intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis that possess a benzoquinone ring with a polyisoprenoid tail but lack a methyl group at the C-3 position of the quinone head group. These molecules contain methoxy groups at positions C-5 and C-6 (or their equivalent positions depending on numbering) and a hydroxyl or methoxy group at C-2, but critically have only a hydrogen atom rather than a methyl group at C-3, distinguishing them from the final ubiquinone product. The enzymatic conversion of 3-demethylubiquinones to ubiquinones is catalyzed by the UbiG methyltransferase (also known as COQ3 in eukaryotes), which uses S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor to perform the final methylation step at the C-3 position. This enzyme exhibits specificity for the 3-demethylubiquinone substrate and transfers the methyl group from SAM to generate ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) and S-adenosylhomocysteine as a byproduct. The methylation at C-3 is typically one of the final steps in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway and is essential for producing the fully functional electron carrier, as the methyl group at this position contributes to the redox properties and hydrophobicity of the molecule. In bacteria, this conversion follows earlier modifications including hydroxylations and O-methylations at other positions on the benzoquinone ring, while in eukaryotes the pathway occurs in mitochondria with similar enzymatic logic but different enzyme nomenclature.",345,384,0.006795,True,62.79,"According to PubMed, 3-demethylubiquinones are late-stage intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis characterized by a benzoquinone head group with a polyprenyl tail but lacking a methyl group at the C-5 position of the aromatic ring. The key intermediate in this pathway is demethyl-demethoxy-ubiquinone (DDMQ), which has the structure 2-methoxy-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone, containing a methoxy group at the C-2 position but lacking both the methyl substituent at C-5 and the second methoxy group that will eventually be present at C-3 in mature ubiquinone ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.272.14.9182), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.08.007)). The enzymatic conversion of 3-demethylubiquinones to ubiquinones is catalyzed by the C-methyltransferase enzyme COQ5 (also known as Coq5 in yeast or UbiE in bacteria), an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase that performs the only C-methylation step in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.272.14.9182), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1399004714011559)). Specifically, COQ5 catalyzes the methylation of demethyl-demethoxy-ubiquinone (DDMQ) to form demethoxy-ubiquinone (DMQ) by transferring a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the C-5 position of the benzoquinone ring, converting 2-methoxy-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone to 2-methoxy-5-methyl-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.272.14.9182), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1399004714011559)). This enzyme functions as part of a multi-subunit mitochondrial protein complex called the CoQ-synthome, which is peripherally associated with the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and mutations in COQ5 that impair this methylation step lead to accumulation of the unmethylated DDMQ intermediate and result in coenzyme Q deficiency in humans, manifesting as cerebellar ataxia, encephalopathy, and other neurological symptoms ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.23345), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.08.007)).",42,2125,0.3267214,0.333516,"mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__chembl__search_chembl_molecule, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_molecule, mcp__togomcp__get_pubchem_compound_id, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__get_full_text_article",4,4,4,4,16,"Good description of structural characteristics (missing C-3 methyl) and enzymatic conversion (UbiG/COQ3, SAM-dependent).

The phosphorylated isoform designated p-T481,S486,S493-AXIN1 carries three co-occurring modifications: O-phospho-L-threonine at position 481 and O-phospho-L-serine at positions 486 and 493. These phosphorylation events are documented within the curated biochemical reaction ""AXIN is phosphorylated in the destruction complex"" (R-HSA-5229343), which is a component of the human pathway ""Degradation of beta-catenin by the destruction complex"" (R-HSA-195253), itself nested within the broader ""Signaling by WNT"" hierarchy (R-HSA-195721). Mechanistically, the destruction complex—assembled by AXIN1 as scaffold, together with APC, CK1, and GSK3-beta—sequentially phosphorylates beta-catenin to mark it for proteasomal degradation; the phosphorylation of AXIN1 itself at T481, S486, and S493 enhances its stability within the complex and potentiates beta-catenin turnover, thereby maintaining the off-state of canonical Wnt signaling in the absence of Wnt ligand.
",True,10.91,"AXIN1, as a central scaffold protein of the β-catenin destruction complex, is subject to multiple phosphorylation events that regulate its function in canonical Wnt signaling. The protein contains numerous serine and threonine residues that serve as phosphorylation sites, with several documented in curated pathway databases. Casein kinase 1α (CK1α) phosphorylates AXIN1 at multiple sites, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) also phosphorylates AXIN1 at several serine and threonine residues. Curated human Wnt pathway entries in databases such as Reactome, KEGG, and pathway-specific repositories do document AXIN1 phosphorylation states, with specific annotations indicating concurrent phosphorylation at multiple serine and threonine residues. For example, phosphorylation sites including Ser330, Thr341, and other serine/threonine clusters have been identified and annotated in proteomic studies and incorporated into curated pathway representations. These concurrent phosphorylation events are functionally significant, as they regulate AXIN1's stability, its interactions with other destruction complex components (including APC, GSK3β, and CK1α), and its overall role in controlling β-catenin levels.

question_050,choice,"Among Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which species has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records?

Choose one of the following options:
  - Klebsiella pneumoniae
  - Acinetobacter baumannii
  - Salmonella enterica
  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Salmonella enterica has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records, with 23 distinct classes, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16), and Acinetobacter baumannii (14). The 28 total unique classes across all four species (sum of per-species counts = 75; 75 > 28, indicating 47 class-instances are shared, with core classes such as BETA-LACTAM, AMINOGLYCOSIDE, QUINOLONE, TETRACYCLINE, and SULFONAMIDE present in all four species) reflects extensive horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants among Gram-negative pathogens. Salmonella enterica's broader drug-class repertoire is consistent with its diverse ecological niches spanning human clinical, livestock, and environmental reservoirs, which expose bacterial populations to a wide range of selective antibiotic pressures and facilitate acquisition of resistance genes from taxonomically distant organisms; distinctive Salmonella classes include BLEOMYCIN, STREPTOTHRICIN, RIFAMYCIN, FOSFOMYCIN, and GLYCOPEPTIDE. Notably, this class-breadth ranking diverges from gene-symbol diversity: K. pneumoniae has substantially more distinct gene symbols in AMRPortal but a narrower class range than Salmonella by just one class, reflecting K. pneumoniae's depth in a few resistance mechanisms (especially BETA-LACTAM diversity via ESBLs and carbapenemases) rather than breadth across classes. Acinetobacter baumannii, despite its clinical reputation as extensively drug-resistant, shows the fewest distinct drug classes (14) among the four ESKAPE pathogens in current surveillance records, as its resistance phenotype is largely driven by a concentrated set of OXA-type carbapenemases and efflux pump mechanisms rather than broad class diversification.
",True,7.29,"**Klebsiella pneumoniae** is the correct answer.

Klebsiella pneumoniae has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records among these four species. This organism commonly harbors resistance genes against beta-lactams (including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, carbapenemases like KPC, NDM, and OXA-48-like enzymes), aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, phenicols, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, macrolides, fosfomycin, and colistin (mcr genes). K. pneumoniae's prominence in healthcare settings, its propensity to acquire mobile genetic elements carrying diverse resistance determinants, and its role as a major opportunistic pathogen has made it a focal point of antimicrobial resistance surveillance programs worldwide. While P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii are also highly drug-resistant pathogens with multiple resistance mechanisms, and S. enterica shows resistance to several drug classes, K. pneumoniae typically demonstrates the broadest repertoire of characterized resistance genes spanning the most antibiotic classes in genotypic surveillance databases, reflecting both its clinical importance and extensive genomic characterization efforts.",289,280,0.005067,True,40.87,"**Salmonella enterica**

Salmonella enterica has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records with 24 different classes, followed closely by Klebsiella pneumoniae with 22 classes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa with 16 classes, and Acinetobacter baumannii with 14 classes. This finding reflects the extensive surveillance and genomic characterization of Salmonella isolates, which are a major cause of foodborne illness and are frequently monitored across diverse global settings. The comprehensive resistance profiling of Salmonella captures a broad spectrum of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms spanning major drug classes including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, quinolones, phenicols, macrolides, and various efflux pump systems, demonstrating the pathogen's capacity to acquire and maintain resistance determinants across multiple antibiotic families.",25,1080,0.23251835,0.237585,"mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",2,4,5,4,15,Wrong answer: selects Klebsiella pneumoniae instead of Salmonella enterica.
