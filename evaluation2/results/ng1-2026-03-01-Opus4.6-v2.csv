question_004,summary,Summarize the distribution of melatonin biosynthesis enzymes across species and characterize their molecular functions and the chemical intermediates involved.,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are distributed across 16 species spanning three kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi), with 33 reviewed proteins in total. Mammals account for 14 proteins across 9 taxa, including two human paralogs (AANAT and ASMT), with coverage extending to mouse, rat, cattle, sheep, macaque, hamster, chimpanzee, and Mus musculus molossinus. Plants contribute 14 proteins from 4 taxa: Arabidopsis thaliana (4 proteins), Oryza sativa subsp. japonica (7 proteins, the most of any single organism), Oryza sativa subsp. indica (1 protein), and Zea mays (2 proteins). Additional representatives include two bird proteins in Gallus gallus, two insect proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, and one fungal protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The pathway proceeds through two enzymatic steps acting on distinct chemical intermediates: first, aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT, GO:0004059, a subclass of N-acetyltransferase activity) converts serotonin (CHEBI:28790, C10H12N2O) to N-acetylserotonin (CHEBI:17697, C12H14N2O2); then acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT, GO:0017096, a subclass of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity) converts N-acetylserotonin to melatonin (CHEBI:16796, C13H16N2O2). Exactly 17 proteins are annotated with AANAT activity and 16 with ASMT activity, with no overlap. This enzymatic conservation across evolutionarily distant taxa — from yeast to plants to mammals — indicates an ancient origin of the two-step melatonin biosynthesis mechanism, with the pathway starting from tryptophan (CHEBI:27897, C11H12N2O2) via serotonin as the upstream precursor.
",True,11.56,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are distributed across diverse taxonomic groups, including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, bacteria, and unicellular eukaryotes, though the specific enzymatic pathways show considerable evolutionary variation. In vertebrates, the canonical pathway begins with tryptophan, which is converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase, then to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Serotonin is subsequently converted to N-acetylserotonin by arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in many species and exhibits remarkable regulatory flexibility through phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation. The final step involves hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), also called acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT), which transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to N-acetylserotonin, producing melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). In some species, alternative pathways exist where serotonin is first methylated to 5-methoxytryptamine, then acetylated to melatonin, demonstrating pathway plasticity. Plants utilize similar enzymatic machinery but with different gene families, employing tryptophan decarboxylase, tryptamine 5-hydroxylase, serotonin N-acetyltransferase, and N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase, with considerable variability in enzyme specificity and subcellular localization. Invertebrates display intermediate characteristics, with some possessing AANAT orthologs while others use functionally analogous but structurally distinct enzymes. The tissue distribution varies dramatically across species: vertebrate melatonin synthesis occurs primarily in the pineal gland and retina, though extrapineal synthesis in gastrointestinal tract, immune cells, and other tissues is increasingly recognized, while in plants, melatonin synthesis occurs in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and cytoplasm across multiple tissue types.",333,501,0.008514,True,100.81,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information. Let me compile the answer:

Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are widely distributed across animals, plants, and fungi, with two core enzymes catalyzing the conserved final steps of the pathway. Aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT; EC 2.3.1.87), also called serotonin N-acetyltransferase, acetylates serotonin to produce N-acetylserotonin using acetyl-CoA as the acetyl donor. This enzyme is represented in 17 reviewed protein entries and is found across vertebrates including humans, mice, rats, sheep, cattle, chickens, and primates, as well as in invertebrates such as Drosophila. Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT; EC 2.1.1.4), also known as hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase, catalyzes the final methylation step by transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine onto N-acetylserotonin to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine), with 14 reviewed entries spanning mammals, birds, and fish. Plants employ homologous enzymes in their chloroplasts, with rice (Oryza sativa) expressing multiple isoforms of both SNAT and ASMT, and Arabidopsis utilizing GCN5-related N-acetyltransferases (GNAT1 and GNAT2) that exhibit dual substrate specificity for both serotonin acetylation and protein acetylation. The chemical pathway proceeds from L-tryptophan (C₁₁H₁₂N₂O₂) through 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (C₁₁H₁₂N₂O₃) to serotonin (C₁₀H₁₂N₂O), which is then N-acetylated by AANAT to yield N-acetylserotonin (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₂), and finally O-methylated by ASMT to produce melatonin (C₁₃H₁₆N₂O₂). An alternative route involving 5-methoxytryptamine acetylation also converges to melatonin synthesis. Beyond their primary enzymatic roles, these proteins participate in diverse physiological processes: in plants, they mediate stress responses to pathogens like Botrytis cinerea, regulate stomatal dynamics for drought tolerance, modulate circadian rhythms, control seed germination, and contribute to photosynthetic state transitions; in animals, they regulate circadian sleep-wake cycles through pineal gland melatonin secretion in vertebrates, with particularly high expression in the mammalian pineal gland where AANAT serves as the rate-limiting enzyme subject to circadian and photoperiodic regulation.",54,4332,0.5860674000000001,0.594581,"mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__ols__search, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__ols__search, mcp__ols__search, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",3,3,4,4,14,"Covers the enzymatic steps and chemical intermediates well (tryptophan→serotonin→N-acetylserotonin→melatonin), mentions AANAT and ASMT.

question_005,choice,"Among the following kinase groups — AGC, CAMK, CMGC, and TK — which has the greatest number of human protein targets with experimentally determined X-ray crystal structures deposited in the PDB?

Choose one of the following options:
  - AGC
  - CAMK
  - CMGC
  - TK","TK (tyrosine kinases) has the greatest number of human protein targets with
PDB X-ray crystal structures, with 2,280 structures across 80 ChEMBL-classified
human targets. CMGC ranks second (1,539 structures, 58 targets), followed by
CAMK (734 structures, 65 targets) and AGC (422 structures, 59 targets).

TK dominates structural coverage because tyrosine kinases are the primary targets
in cancer drug discovery. The EGFR family alone (EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4) accounts
for hundreds of entries; BCR-ABL1 (P00519) has over 200 structures due to
imatinib-resistance studies; VEGFR2/KDR (P35968), ALK (Q9UM73), c-MET (P08581),
RET (P07949), FGFR1-4, and the SRC family kinases each contribute dozens to
hundreds of structures. The pharmaceutical industry's intense focus on TK
inhibitors for oncology has driven an outsized crystallographic effort relative
to the number of targets.

CMGC ranks second because it includes intensively studied targets: CDK2 (P24941)
alone has over 400 PDB structures from fragment-based and structure-based drug
design campaigns; CDK4/6 (cyclin-dependent kinases), CDK8, CDK9, MAPK1/ERK2
(P28482), MAPK14/p38α (Q16539), GSK3B (P49841), and DYRK1A (Q13627) are all
major drug targets with large structural datasets.

CAMK ranks third despite having the most targets (65) among the four groups,
because many CAMK members (e.g., CaM kinases, DAPK, CHK1, CHK2) are less
pharmacologically tractable or have been structurally solved fewer times.

AGC ranks last (422 structures) despite its prominent members (AKT1/2/3, PKCα,
PKA, RSK1-4, S6K1) because several AGC kinases proved challenging for structural
biology due to flexibility or membrane association, and the group has fewer
members overall.

A note on cross-group overlap: 70 PDB structures (1.4%) contain proteins with
dual classification in ChEMBL (6 proteins annotated as both AGC and CAMK). These
structures are counted in both groups' totals. This overlap does not affect the

This clinical importance has driven intensive drug discovery efforts, resulting in numerous structures of these kinases in complex with various inhibitors and in different conformational states. While the AGC, CAMK, and CMGC groups also contain well-studied kinases with multiple structures (such as PKA, CAMKII, and CDKs), the sheer number of TK family members that are validated drug targets, combined with the pharmaceutical industry's focus on developing tyrosine kinase inhibitors as cancer therapeutics, has led to a disproportionately large number of TK structures being deposited in the PDB compared to the other kinase groups.",256,254,0.004578,True,150.1,"Excellent!

Across all three categories, Firmicutes is the dominant phylum, contributing 2,096 anaerobes, 1,686 facultative anaerobes, and 94 obligate anaerobes; Proteobacteria ranks second among anaerobes (810) and ties with Firmicutes among facultative anaerobes (1,683); Actinobacteria accounts for 676 anaerobes and 490 facultative anaerobes, while Bacteroidetes contributes 351 anaerobes and 111 facultative anaerobes. At the order level, Lactobacillales leads with 1,557 strains, followed by Clostridiales (861), Enterobacterales (741), Actinomycetales (557), and Eubacteriales (409). Temperature data from BacDive's structured CultureTemperature records show that general anaerobes (4,707 strains with temperature data) grow across an extraordinarily broad range of −2 to 103°C with an average optimum near 36.4°C, facultative anaerobes (4,224 strains) span 0–90°C with a cooler mean of 26.8°C reflecting their greater ecological breadth, and obligate anaerobes (216 strains) average 36.9°C with a range of −1.8 to 112°C indicating adaptation to extreme environments. Cross-database integration with MediaDive identifies 4,984 anaerobic strains with linked medium records; the most commonly used media are Columbia Blood Medium (744 strains), EG Medium (402), Trypticase Soy Yeast Extract Medium (357), PYG Medium modified (330), and BL Agar (249), reflecting the nutritionally rich, reduced-oxygen formulations required by these organisms.
",True,9.86,"Anaerobic bacteria are taxonomically diverse, distributed across multiple phyla including Firmicutes (containing key genera like Clostridium, Bacteroides, and Peptostreptococcus), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria, with significant representation in the human gut microbiome and environmental habitats. These organisms exhibit varying oxygen tolerance levels: obligate anaerobes are killed by atmospheric oxygen concentrations and lack superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes (examples include Clostridium species and Bacteroides fragilis); aerotolerant anaerobes can survive oxygen exposure but do not use it for growth (such as some Lactobacillus species); and facultative anaerobes can switch between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism depending on oxygen availability (like Escherichia coli). Standard culture conditions require strict anaerobic techniques, typically employing anaerobic chambers or jars with oxygen-scavenging systems (palladium catalysts with hydrogen gas or chemical oxygen absorbers), reduced media containing cysteine, thioglycolate, or other reducing agents to maintain low redox potentials (typically -150 to -200 mV), and gas mixtures of 80-90% nitrogen, 5-10% hydrogen, and 5-10% carbon dioxide. Culture media are often supplemented with hemin, vitamin K, blood, or rumen fluid to support fastidious anaerobes, with incubation temperatures ranging from 35-37°C for mesophilic species to 55-65°C for thermophilic anaerobes, and pH values typically maintained between 6.5 and 7.5, though some species require more acidic or alkaline conditions.",330,394,0.0069,True,86.18,"Based on the comprehensive data retrieved from the BacDive bacterial diversity database, I now have sufficient information to provide a complete answer about anaerobic bacteria. Let me synthesize this information into a cohesive paragraph.

Anaerobic bacteria documented in bacterial diversity databases exhibit broad taxonomic distribution across both domains of life, with 8,532 bacterial strains and 406 archaeal strains characterized by anaerobic metabolism. Within Bacteria, the dominant phyla include Firmicutes (3,692 strains), Proteobacteria (2,492 strains), and Actinobacteria (1,142 strains), with significant representation also from Bacteroidetes (467 strains), Fusobacteria (124 strains), and Spirochaetes (63 strains), while archaeal anaerobes are primarily represented by Euryarchaeota (361 strains) and Crenarchaeota (45 strains). At the class level, Bacilli (2,234 strains), Gammaproteobacteria (1,638 strains), and Clostridia (1,390 strains) constitute the largest groups. Oxygen tolerance characteristics show three main categories: general anaerobes (4,776 strains representing organisms intolerant to atmospheric oxygen levels), facultative anaerobes (4,310 strains capable of growth with or without oxygen), and obligate anaerobes (224 strains requiring complete absence of oxygen). Typical culture conditions for anaerobic bacteria span wide ranges, with temperature requirements from 4°C to 98°C depending on species—mesophiles commonly growing at 20-45°C (optimal around 30-37°C) and thermophiles thriving at 60-92°C (optimal 80-85°C)—and pH tolerance ranging from 5.0 to 9.5, with most anaerobes preferring neutral to slightly alkaline conditions (pH 6.5-8.0).

question_009,list,Which human enzymes with catalytic roles in the leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway are documented drug targets in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records?,"Five of the eight human enzymes with catalytic roles in the Reactome leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway have mechanism-of-action records in ChEMBL. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, CHEMBL215) has the most ChEMBL mechanism records of any pathway enzyme, with eight drugs documented as inhibitors, including zileuton (phase 4), the only FDA-approved drug specifically indicated for asthma that acts by reversibly inhibiting this rate-limiting step in leukotriene synthesis, as well as five other phase-4 anti-inflammatory agents (mesalamine, sulfasalazine, balsalazide disodium, olsalazine sodium, meclofenamate sodium) and two phase-2 clinical candidates (PF-4191834, atreleuton). The 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP/FLAP, CHEMBL4550) is the most clinically active target, with three distinct phase-3 clinical inhibitors — fiboflapon, fiboflapon sodium, and veliflapon — all documented as INHIBITOR mechanisms. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H, CHEMBL4618), which converts LTA4 to the potent chemoattractant LTB4, is targeted by acebilustat at phase 2. The multidrug resistance-associated protein ABCC1/MRP1 (CHEMBL3004), which exports LTC4 across the cell membrane as part of the pathway, is targeted by the phase-2 multidrug resistance modulator biricodar. MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2, CHEMBL2208), which activates ALOX5 via phosphorylation, is targeted at phase 1 by AT-13148, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor. Three pathway enzymes — arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1), and leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) — lack ChEMBL mechanism records despite participating in the pathway, reflecting their lower prioritisation as drug targets in clinical development programmes.
",True,8.32,"The key human enzymes with catalytic roles in the leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway that are documented drug targets in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records include 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), which catalyzes the first committed step in leukotriene synthesis by converting arachidonic acid to leukotriene A4, and is targeted by zileuton, an approved asthma medication. Leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) conjugates glutathione to leukotriene A4 to form leukotriene C4, representing another validated target in this pathway. Additionally, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP/ALOX5AP), while not directly catalytic, is an essential regulatory protein that presents arachidonic acid to 5-lipoxygenase and is targeted by several drug candidates with documented mechanisms of action in ChEMBL. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), which converts leukotriene A4 to the pro-inflammatory mediator leukotriene B4, is also a documented drug target with specific mechanism-of-action records. The 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15) enzyme, which is involved in eoxin biosynthesis through metabolism of arachidonic acid via similar oxidative pathways, represents another target with ChEMBL documentation, though therapeutic agents targeting this enzyme for eoxin modulation are less clinically advanced than those targeting the leukotriene-specific enzymes.",344,371,0.006597,True,114.88,"Excellent!

Leukotriene A-4 hydrolase (LTA4H, EC 3.3.2.6 and EC 3.4.11.4) catalyzes the conversion of leukotriene A4 to leukotriene B4 and has one documented inhibitor mechanism with acebilustat in phase 2 development. Leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S, EC 4.4.1.20) converts leukotriene A4 and eoxin A4 to leukotriene C4 and eoxin C4 respectively; while it possesses catalytic activity critical to both pathways, it currently lacks documented mechanism-of-action records in ChEMBL. Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12, EC 1.13.11.31) is targeted by one inhibitor mechanism with the approved drug benoxaprofen, though this drug was withdrawn from the market. Notably, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP/FLAP) has three documented inhibitor mechanisms with phase 3 candidates fiboflapon, fiboflapon sodium, and veliflapon, but it functions as an accessory protein rather than a catalyst and thus does not meet the catalytic role criterion despite its essential function in leukotriene biosynthesis.",54,5002,0.6770753,0.683672,"mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",2,3,4,4,13,Mentions ALOX5 with zileuton correctly.

This substantially exceeds connective tissue disorder (134 TopicalDescriptors), autoimmune disease (61 TopicalDescriptors), and rheumatic disorder (39 TopicalDescriptors). The counts reflect confirmed joins with the MeSH RDF graph restricted to meshv:TopicalDescriptor entries (i.e., canonical MeSH headings used for indexing); MONDO cross-references to MeSH supplementary concept records (MESH:C...) are excluded. The four categories are not mutually exclusive: immune system disorder is the broadest and contains the other three as subcategories, so their diseases are counted within it as well — the sum across categories (482) exceeds the 346 unique diseases with TopicalDescriptor mappings due to this intentional overlap in the ontology hierarchy. The higher absolute count for immune system disorder reflects its greater scope rather than a higher per-disease mapping rate, since autoimmune disease and rheumatic disorder actually have proportionally good coverage relative to their size.
",True,6.68,"The correct answer is **autoimmune disease**.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is classified under multiple parent disease categories in medical ontologies, including autoimmune disease, connective tissue disorder, immune system disorder, and rheumatic disorder.

While connective tissue disorders and rheumatic disorders are more specific subcategories that contain fewer total diseases, and immune system disorder is extremely broad but less systematically mapped in MeSH's hierarchical structure, the autoimmune disease category represents an optimal level of specificity that has been comprehensively curated in MeSH, resulting in the highest count of diseases with confirmed TopicalDescriptor mappings.",242,264,0.004686,True,49.15,"Perfect!

Querying Rhea reactions whose equation text mentions ""chlorophyll"" or ""bacteriochlorophyll"" and extracting their associated ChEBI compound identifiers (via the rh:chebi property) yields 64 unique ChEBI chemical entities involved in these pathways. These ChEBI classes serve as type annotations for PubChem compound entries (via rdf:type assertions), enabling cross-database integration. Filtering for PubChem compounds (those with URIs starting with ""http://rdf.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/compound/"") that are typed by any of these 64 ChEBI classes yields 24 distinct compounds. These include central pathway intermediates such as protoporphyrinogen IX, Mg-protoporphyrin IX, and various chlorophyllide derivatives, as well as cofactors like NADPH, ATP, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine.

The database records 286 total glycosylation site entries for decorin, reflecting the multiple glycan structures (glycoforms) annotated at individual positions — position 211 alone carries 132 distinct glycoform entries and position 262 carries 121, indicating extensive N-glycan microheterogeneity at these asparagine residues. The site at position 34 corresponds to the canonical glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin/dermatan sulfate) attachment serine characteristic of the proteoglycan core protein.

question_015,summary,"Characterize the reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 across three dimensions: their GO-annotated functional module assignments (capsid, baseplate, and tail components); any enzymatic activities encoded among these otherwise structural late proteins; and their experimental structural coverage, including the relative proportions of cryo-electron microscopy versus X-ray crystallography depositions.","The 25 reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4, all annotated with KW-0426, collectively encode the phage's iconic contractile tail-injection nanomachine and partition into four major GO-defined structural modules: the capsid (2 proteins: CAPSH/major capsid protein, CAPSP/capsid vertex), the baseplate (11 proteins: the ten wedge and hub assembly proteins gp7, gp10, gp25, gp27, gp48, gp53, gp54, gp26, gp28, gp51, plus the pre-baseplate central spike gp5), the tail tube and completion system (4 proteins: gp19 tube, tail tube terminator, tape-measure protein, gp15 tail completion protein), and the tail fibers (5 proteins: short fiber gp12, three long-fiber subunits gp35/gp36/gp37, and the long-fiber proximal subunit), with the structural collar protein fibritin (WAC) and two DNA helicase isoforms (uvsW and uvsW1) completing the set. Enzymatically, two late proteins break the ""purely structural"" expectation: gp5 (NEEDL_BPT4) bears lysozyme activity (GO:0003796) that hydrolyzes peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall to puncture the host envelope during injection, while the uvsW DNA helicases (GO:0043138, 3'-5' DNA helicase activity) drive late-phase recombination and repair, a function unusual for proteins expressed after DNA replication has begun. Of the 25 proteins, 17 (68%) are structurally characterized in PDB via at least one entry, yielding 149 distinct structures (103 by cryo-electron microscopy, 44 by X-ray crystallography, 2 by solution NMR); because T4 assemblies are large multi-subunit complexes—the baseplate alone contains 11 late proteins—the same PDB entry frequently references multiple T4 proteins, producing 182 total protein-to-entry attributions for 149 distinct structures (33 attribution counts arise from co-occurrence in assemblies). The striking dominance of cryo-EM (69% of entries) reflects the field's shift toward studying intact viral assemblies: fibritin alone accounts for 104 of these entries due to its adoption as an engineering scaffold, while the gp5 spike (18 entries) and major capsid protein (9 entries) follow; the eight structurally uncharacterized proteins—most notably the three baseplate hub proteins gp26, gp28, and gp51, the two long tail-fiber subunits gp35 and gp36, and the two uvsW helicase isoforms—represent current frontiers in T4 structural biology.
",True,12.23,"The late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 comprise over 20 reviewed structural components distributed across three major GO-annotated functional modules: the icosahedral capsid (including major head protein gp23, vertex protein gp24, portal protein gp20, and head completion proteins gp13 and gp14), the baseplate (consisting of central hub protein gp27, wedge proteins gp6, gp7, gp10, gp25, and gp53, and baseplate proteins gp8, gp9, gp11, gp12, and gp48), and the contractile tail apparatus (featuring tail sheath protein gp18, tail tube protein gp19, tail terminator proteins gp3 and gp15, and long tail fibers gp34, gp35, gp36, and gp37). Despite their predominantly structural roles, several of these late proteins possess enzymatic activities: gp5 functions as a lysozyme to degrade peptidoglycan during infection, gp12 encodes a short tail fiber with DNase activity, and the long tail fibers contain enzymatic domains for host receptor binding and degradation. The experimental structural coverage of these proteins reflects the evolution of structural biology techniques, with earlier characterizations dominated by X-ray crystallography structures of individual domains and smaller proteins (such as gp5 lysozyme, fiber components, and baseplate wedge proteins), while more recent efforts have utilized cryo-electron microscopy to determine near-atomic resolution structures of larger assemblies including the complete baseplate, the tail-baseplate complex, and the entire virion with extended and contracted tail conformations.

This order, which includes well-studied nitrogen-fixing alpha-proteobacteria such as Rhizobium phaseoli (6 genes), Rhodopseudomonas palustris (4 genes), and Xanthobacter autotrophicus (4 genes), is the predominant source of characterized nitrogenase genes in current genomic databases, reflecting decades of genome sequencing focused on agriculturally important symbiotic and free-living diazotrophs. Eubacteriales (formerly Clostridiales) ranks second with 19 nifH/nifD genes from 8 organisms, including Clostridium pasteurianum DSM 525 (7 genes) as the dominant contributor, alongside other anaerobic nitrogen fixers such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum (3 genes) and Clostridium beijerinckii (2 genes). Burkholderiales has 11 genes from 5 organisms including the endophyte Herbaspirillum seropedicae, while Pseudomonadales has only 7 genes from 2 organisms, notably Azotobacter chroococcum. The dominance of Hyphomicrobiales (66 genes, 64% of the 103 genes in these four orders) reflects the extensive genome sequencing of alpha-proteobacterial diazotrophs and the multiple nifH/nifD paralogs retained in some of these organisms. Across the full NCBI Gene database, 375 nifH/nifD genes span 174 organisms, demonstrating that nitrogen fixation capability is phylogenetically scattered well beyond these four orders, including in diverse Archaea (e.g., Methanocaldococcus) and sulfate-reducing bacteria.

A MediaDive query confirmed zero nitrogen-containing ingredients (no nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, or urea) in BG11-, establishing that the strain grows without any external fixed-nitrogen source. BG11- medium lacks fixed nitrogen sources, requiring nitrogen-fixing strains like Anabaena to form specialized heterocyst cells for atmospheric nitrogen fixation. This psychrophilic strain isolated from sediment can fix atmospheric nitrogen through the nitrogenase enzyme complex housed within heterocysts, specialized anaerobic cells that protect oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase from photosynthetic oxygen production. The cross-database integration between BacDive (strain characterization) and MediaDive (validated cultivation protocols) confirms this nitrogen-independent growth capability.

question_020,yes_no,Does the bacterial genome assembly CP036276.1 of Symmachiella dynata strain Mal52 encode more than one copy of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene?,"The bacterial genome assembly CP036276.1 of Symmachiella dynata strain Mal52 encodes two copies of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The first copy is located at positions 436,264–437,809 bp on the forward strand, and the second copy at positions 5,256,596–5,258,141 bp on the reverse strand. Together with a 23S ribosomal RNA gene (1,040,576–1,043,484 bp) and a 5S ribosomal RNA gene (1,043,659–1,043,768 bp), the genome harbors four ribosomal RNA features in total. The spatial arrangement of the 23S and 5S rRNA genes adjacent to the first 16S copy suggests that these three form a classical prokaryotic rRNA operon (16S-23S-5S), while the second 16S copy at a distant locus may represent an incomplete or independent operon. The presence of multiple 16S rRNA gene copies is commonly associated with the capacity for faster ribosome production and more rapid adaptation to nutrient availability, as rRNA gene copy number correlates with maximum growth rate in bacteria. This structural information is retrievable directly from the INSDC nucleotide sequence record via the DDBJ RDF endpoint, with features linked to NCBI Taxonomy identifier 2527995 through the RO:in taxon relationship.

However, I can provide relevant context: bacterial genomes typically contain multiple copies of the 16S rRNA gene, with copy numbers ranging from one to fifteen depending on the species, and most bacteria having between one and seven copies. These multiple copies are thought to facilitate rapid ribosome synthesis during periods of active growth.

question_021,summary,"Summarize the human proteasome protein landscape as defined by the UniProt keyword KW-0647 (Proteasome), characterizing the distribution across GO cellular component subcomplexes (20S core, 19S regulatory, accessory), the overlap in multi-subcomplex annotations, and the fraction represented as ChEMBL drug targets.","There are 53 reviewed human proteins classified under UniProt keyword KW-0647 (Proteasome), forming a structurally and functionally diverse complex system. When distributed across eight GO cellular component subcategories using structured ontology IRIs, 49 of these proteins are annotated to the general proteasome complex (GO:0000502), while the 20S core complex (GO:0005839) accounts for 18 proteins, the accessory complex (GO:0022624) for 16, the core beta-subunit complex (GO:0019774) for 11, the regulatory particle base subcomplex (GO:0008540) for 9, the lid subcomplex (GO:0008541) for 8, the alpha-subunit complex (GO:0019773) for 8, and the 19S regulatory particle (GO:0005838) for 7. The sum of these category counts reaches 126 annotations for 52 uniquely annotated proteins (arithmetic verification: 126 > 52 = valid overlap), reflecting extensive multi-subcomplex co-annotation — for example, a beta subunit is simultaneously annotated to the general proteasome complex, the 20S core, and the beta-subunit complex. Four proteins lack the general GO:0000502 annotation entirely: PSMF1 (PI31 inhibitor), PSME4 (PA200 activator), PSB11 (inducible beta-11), and PSMA8 (testis-specific alpha-8). Three of them (PSMF1, PSB11, PSMA8) still appear in subcomplex categories (GO:0005839, GO:0019774, GO:0019773 respectively), while PSME4 carries none of the eight GO subcomplex annotations, consistent with its role as an externally docking activator rather than a structural subunit. Cross-referencing with ChEMBL reveals that 22 of the 53 proteins (41.5%) are registered as human single-protein drug targets, with all eight canonical beta subunits included — consistent with the clinical use of proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib that target the beta5 catalytic subunit (PSMB5).
",True,10.96,"The human proteasome protein landscape defined by UniProt keyword KW-0647 comprises approximately 45-50 proteins that form the 26S proteasome complex and its associated regulatory components.

Multi-subcomplex annotations show minimal overlap for core structural components, as most 20S and 19S subunits are dedicated to their respective subcomplexes, though some accessory proteins like PSME1-4 (PA28 subunits) can interact with multiple proteasome configurations and shuttle between different cellular compartments. Regarding ChEMBL drug targets, approximately 20-30% of proteasome proteins are represented, with the catalytic β-subunits (particularly PSMB5, PSMB8, PSMB9, and PSMB10) being the most extensively targeted due to their essential proteolytic activity, exemplified by FDA-approved proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib used primarily in multiple myeloma treatment.",381,366,0.006633,True,216.65,"Based on the conversation summary, I need to analyze the collected data and provide the single-paragraph summary that was originally requested.

The human proteasome protein landscape comprises 56 manually reviewed UniProt entries annotated with keyword KW-0647, representing the core catalytic and regulatory machinery of this essential protein degradation system. Analysis of Gene Ontology cellular component annotations reveals a hierarchical organization into three functional tiers: the 20S core complex (including alpha- and beta-subunit subcomplexes), the 19S regulatory particle (subdivided into base and lid subcomplexes), and accessory complexes (including proteasome activator complexes). The dataset exhibits substantial multi-subcomplex annotation overlap, with proteins frequently classified under both specific subcomplexes and broader parent terms such as the general ""proteasome complex"" (GO:0000502), reflecting the modular architecture where individual subunits participate in multiple functional assemblies. Notably, approximately 89% (50 of 56) of these proteasome proteins are represented as drug targets in ChEMBL with associated bioactive molecules in clinical development phases or approved status, with particularly high compound activity against the deubiquitinating enzymes USP14 (3,782 molecules) and PSMD14 (3,777 molecules), underscoring the proteasome's significance as a therapeutic target in oncology and immunomodulation. The 20S core complex components predominate in the structural landscape, while the 19S regulatory particle proteins show enrichment in drug target annotations, reflecting their roles in substrate recognition and their appeal as selective therapeutic intervention points that might avoid the toxicity associated with global proteasome inhibition.",32,5239,1.4095856,1.416219,"mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",2,3,4,4,13,"Provides approximate protein count (~45-50, ideal 53) and general subcomplex breakdown.

For the remaining 45 proteins, including ataxin-1 (ATXN1), ataxin-3 (ATXN3), CACNA1A, ITPR1, TBP, and PRKCG among others, their reviewed protein accessions are directly cross-referenced to MANE Select transcripts in Ensembl. The two exceptions arise from distinct annotation issues: for ATXN2, a MANE Select transcript (ENST00000673436) exists, but its encoded protein (ENSP00000500925) is cross-referenced only to an unreviewed TrEMBL accession (A0A5F9ZI57) rather than the canonical reviewed entry Q99700, reflecting an isoform-level discordance between the MANE Select transcript and the curated Swiss-Prot record; for ATXN8, the associated locus (ATXN8OS) is annotated as a non-coding RNA gene in Ensembl—its MANE Select transcript (ENST00000424524) lacks a translated protein with UniProt cross-reference, consistent with the fact that SCA8 pathogenesis involves a non-coding repeat expansion rather than a straightforward protein-coding gene.

Regarding nucleotide cofactors, pyruvate carboxylase uses ATP (CHEBI:15422) to drive the carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, while the human GTP-dependent PEPCK isoform uses GTP (CHEBI:37565) to decarboxylate and phosphorylate oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate; the phosphohydrolases—fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase—require no nucleotide cofactor, instead cleaving phosphate ester bonds using water. In reviewed human UniProt entries, there is 1 protein for pyruvate carboxylase (PYC_HUMAN, P11498), 2 for GTP-dependent PEPCK (cytosolic PCKGC_HUMAN P35558 and mitochondrial PCKGM_HUMAN Q16822), 2 for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (liver F16P1_HUMAN P09467 and muscle F16P2_HUMAN O00757), and 3 for glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC1_HUMAN P35575, G6PC2_HUMAN Q9NQR9, and G6PC3_HUMAN Q9BUM1), giving 8 reviewed human proteins in total.

This substantial variant burden reflects KCNQ2's role as the causal gene for both the severe DEE7 (developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 7, MONDO:0013387) and the milder benign familial neonatal convulsions type 1, making it a major target of clinical sequencing in pediatric epilepsy. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 encode the Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits that co-assemble to form the neuronal M-channel responsible for regulating neuronal excitability; KCNQ2 variants are more frequently pathogenic and more clinically diverse in severity than KCNQ3 variants, which mainly cause the milder BFNC2 (MONDO:0007366). KCNT1 encodes the sodium-activated KNa1.1 (SLACK) channel and causes the severe epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS, MONDO:0100025), while KCNB1 encodes the Kv2.1 delayed-rectifier channel associated with DEE34 (MONDO:0014718); both have a smaller but clinically significant variant spectrum compared to KCNQ2.
",True,7.6,"**KCNQ2**

KCNQ2 has the greatest number of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants documented in ClinVar among these four voltage-gated potassium channel genes. KCNQ2 is associated with a spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes ranging from benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS) to severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, and it was among the first epilepsy genes identified in the 1990s, resulting in longer clinical recognition and more extensive variant cataloging. The gene encodes the Kv7.2 channel subunit that forms M-current channels critical for neuronal excitability regulation. In contrast, while KCNQ3 also causes BFNS and shares functional overlap with KCNQ2, it accounts for fewer cases and has correspondingly fewer documented pathogenic variants. KCNB1 and KCNT1, though both associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, were more recently identified as epilepsy genes (2010s) and are linked to rarer phenotypes, resulting in smaller numbers of curated pathogenic variants in clinical databases compared to the more extensively studied KCNQ2.",312,280,0.005136,True,20.92,"**KCNQ2**

question_027,factoid,How many distinct approved biochemical reactions in the Rhea database are collectively annotated for the reviewed human enzymatic catalysts of the nicotinate metabolism pathway?,"The 22 reviewed human enzymatic catalysts of the Reactome nicotinate metabolism pathway are collectively annotated with 58 distinct approved reactions in the Rhea database. This repertoire encompasses the full biochemical breadth of these enzymes beyond their nicotinate-specific roles: the pathway itself covers the Preiss-Handler route (nicotinate → NaMN → deamido-NAD+ → NAD+ via NAPRT, NMNAT1-3, and NADSYN1), the NAD+ salvage route (nicotinamide → NMN → NAD+ via NAMPT and NMNATs), and NAD+ consumption and recycling steps (CD38/BST1 glycohydrolases, NNMT methyltransferase, NT5E nucleotidase). The per-enzyme Rhea contribution varies widely: the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SLC5A8 (Q8N695) links to 14 approved reactions reflecting its broad substrate range for short-chain carboxylates including nicotinate, while NT5E/CD73 (P21589) contributes 10 reactions covering all its nucleoside monophosphate substrates. CD38 (P28907) accounts for 6 reactions including NAD+ glycohydrolase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, and cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase activities. The 58-reaction total from 22 enzymes (68 protein-reaction pairs) reflects 10 shared reactions catalysed by multiple enzyme paralogues — for instance, the core NAD+ glycohydrolase reaction (Rhea:16301) is shared by both CD38 and BST1/CD157. In contrast, NAMPT, NADK, NAPRT, QPRT, and NNMT each contribute a single Rhea reaction reflecting their narrow substrate specificity, while NMNAT1 (Q9HAN9) contributes 2 approved reactions — covering both NMN (Rhea:21360) and NaMN (Rhea:22860) as substrates — consistent with its dual role in both the salvage and Preiss-Handler de novo routes to NAD+.
",True,7.89,"I cannot provide a specific numerical answer to this question as it requires real-time access to the Rhea database and cross-referencing with reviewed human enzymes involved in nicotinate metabolism from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

This information changes as databases are updated with new annotations, enzyme characterizations, and reaction data. To obtain an accurate count, one would need to perform a structured query accessing the current versions of Rhea, UniProt, and relevant pathway databases such as KEGG or Reactome, filtering for human enzymes with reviewed status that participate in nicotinate metabolic processes, and tallying their unique Rhea-annotated reactions while avoiding duplicate counting of the same reaction catalyzed by different enzymes.",336,247,0.004713,True,191.44,"Excellent!

The 98 specific ECs span primarily the four canonical glycosyltransferase sub-classes — hexosyltransferases (EC 2.4.1.x, the largest group), pentosyltransferases (EC 2.4.2.x), N-acylneuraminyltransferases (EC 2.4.3.x), and sialyltransferases (EC 2.4.99.x) — plus additional enzyme activities present in proteins tagged with KW-0328: an acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.286), a phosphotransferase/lipid metabolism enzyme (EC 2.7.8.15), and two glycoside hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.45 and EC 3.2.1.46). The 128 Rhea master reactions cover a broad range of sugar-transfer chemistries, including O-glycan and N-glycan elongation, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, proteoglycan assembly, GPI-anchor remodelling, ADP-ribosylation, and nucleotide-sugar metabolism, reflecting the diverse cellular roles of human glycosyltransferases in development, immunity, and signalling.

This distribution was determined by cross-referencing the 141 reviewed human serine protease sequences from UniProt Swiss-Prot (keyword KW-0720, Homo sapiens) against all PDB entries via the UniProt accession links in the structure database. The total of 2,055 unique PDB entries spans five experimental techniques; two minor methods — ELECTRON CRYSTALLOGRAPHY (1 entry) and NEUTRON DIFFRACTION (1 entry) — also appear. The 2,056 method-level annotations for 2,055 unique entries indicate that one entry was deposited under two experimental methods (valid overlap). The overwhelming dominance of X-ray crystallography (91.5% of entries) reflects the historical tractability of serine proteases for crystal formation: their well-defined active-site geometry, availability of high-affinity inhibitor co-crystals, and pharmaceutical relevance as drug targets have driven decades of intensive crystallographic campaigns. Electron microscopy is still underrepresented for this family because most clinically relevant serine proteases are monomeric enzymes with molecular weights below ~100 kDa, at the lower end of optimal cryo-EM resolution, whereas solution NMR captures only the smaller members of the family.

The success of X-ray crystallography for serine proteases stems from their generally favorable crystallization properties, well-defined domain structures, and typically compact folds (usually 20-30 kDa for the catalytic domain). In contrast, solution NMR has contributed relatively few serine protease structures due to size limitations of the technique and the challenges of studying these enzymes in solution, while electron microscopy has historically been used primarily for much larger macromolecular complexes rather than individual serine protease domains.

In MedGen's MGREL database, this concept has 47 documented ""manifestation_of"" relationships, one of which links it to Cholecystitis (MedGen:C0008325). While metachromatic leukodystrophy is primarily known for progressive neurological manifestations — including peripheral demyelination, cerebellar ataxia, and intellectual disability — gallbladder involvement, including Cholecystitis and gallbladder dysfunction, is documented in the structured clinical data. This reflects the systemic nature of sulfatide accumulation in MLD: ARSA normally degrades sulfatides in lysosomes throughout the body, and excess sulfatide deposits in gallbladder epithelial cells and bile ducts can lead to cholecystitis and gallbladder polyps.

question_038,choice,"Among the five Mus musculus limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs Capn3, Dysf, Lmna, Ano5, and Plec, which has the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts in Ensembl GRCm39?

Choose one of the following options:

Plec's exceptional transcript diversity reflects its unique genomic architecture: the mouse Plec gene encodes at least 11 alternative first exons (1a–1j and a common exon 2) that each splice into a shared downstream coding region, producing tissue-specific isoforms directed to distinct subcellular compartments — for example, isoform 1a targets hemidesmosomes in epithelia while isoform 1f localises to costameres and Z-discs in striated muscle. Dysf's 12 isoforms reflect alternative splicing of its tandem C2 domain array, relevant to its role in membrane repair at the sarcolemma. Capn3's 10 isoforms include the muscle-specific p94 form and lens isoform Lp82 arising from alternative promoter usage. By contrast, Lmna (4 isoforms, primarily lamin A and lamin C from alternative splicing at exon 10) and Ano5 (3 isoforms) are architecturally simpler. The striking isoform count difference between Plec and Ano5 (21 vs. 3) therefore does not reflect clinical severity but rather the mechanistic complexity of their membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding roles versus channel/lipid scramblase functions.
",True,7.43,"The correct answer is **Lmna**.

Lmna (Lamin A/C) has the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts among these five limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs in Ensembl GRCm39. LMNA is known for its extensive alternative splicing, producing multiple protein isoforms including the major products lamin A and lamin C, which arise from alternative splicing of exon 10. The gene exhibits considerable transcript diversity due to alternative promoter usage, alternative splicing, and alternative polyadenylation sites. This complexity reflects the multiple cellular functions of lamins as structural components of the nuclear lamina and their roles in chromatin organization, gene regulation, and mechanical stability of the nucleus. In contrast, the other genes in this list—Capn3 (calpain-3), Dysf (dysferlin), Ano5 (anoctamin-5), and Plec (plectin)—while they may have multiple transcripts, typically show less extensive alternative splicing compared to Lmna.

SCN5A encodes the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 and is the primary causal gene for Brugada syndrome, responsible for 15–30% of cases through loss-of-function variants; its ChEMBL entry reflects its central role as a drug target for antiarrhythmic compounds and as a cardiac safety liability. The potassium channels KCNH2 (hERG) and KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) are prominent ChEMBL targets because inhibition of hERG is a major mechanism of drug-induced QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. CACNA1C encodes the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2, a target for dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. RYR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) is targeted by flecainide and other agents used in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, a related channelopathy with substantial overlap in the research literature. The complete overlap between the high-frequency co-annotation set and ChEMBL pharmacological targets reflects the ion-channel-centric pathophysiology of Brugada syndrome and the translational significance of these genes in cardiac drug development and safety pharmacology.

The remaining seven siglecs (SIGLEC6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16) are recorded in GlyCosmos with glycosylation site predictions from GlyGen but lack curated per-site glycan composition data. Three of the four characterized siglecs (SIGLEC5, 7, 8) are CD33-related inhibitory receptors carrying cytoplasmic ITIMs, while SIGLEC14 is an activating receptor paired with DAP12; all four are expressed primarily on myeloid or NK cells and play roles in immune tolerance, allergy regulation, and innate immune modulation. Dense N-glycosylation of siglec ectodomains is biologically significant because the glycan shield can occlude the V-set sialic acid-binding domain, favoring cis-ligand masking on the cell surface over trans-ligand engagement, and modulating receptor clustering and signaling thresholds.

question_045,summary,"What are the structural characteristics of 3-demethylubiquinones as intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis, and how are they enzymatically converted to ubiquinones?","3-Demethylubiquinones are penultimate intermediates in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway that differ from their mature ubiquinone counterparts by a single structural feature: a free hydroxyl group (-OH) at ring position 3 instead of the methoxyl group (-OCH3) found in ubiquinones, classifying them ontologically as monohydroxy-1,4-benzoquinones within the broader ubiquinone family. This single substituent difference translates to a molecular mass difference of approximately 14 Da for each chain-length variant; for example, 3-demethylubiquinone-9 has the molecular formula C53H80O4 with a molecular weight of 781.2 Da (compared to 795.2 Da for ubiquinone-9), while 3-demethylubiquinone-10 has the formula C58H88O4 with a molecular weight of 849.3 Da (compared to 863.3 Da for coenzyme Q10). Their conversion to ubiquinones is catalyzed by SAM-dependent O-methyltransferases in a reaction where S-adenosyl-L-methionine donates a methyl group to the hydroxyl at position 3, yielding the corresponding ubiquinol (reduced) or ubiquinone (oxidized) product along with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. The Rhea database catalogues 7 approved reactions of this type, comprising 2 generic reactions covering the entire class of 3-demethylubiquinone and 3-demethylubiquinol species and 5 chain-length-specific reactions for the n=6, n=7, n=8, n=9, and n=10 polyprenyl variants that predominate across different organisms.
",True,10.77,"3-Demethylubiquinones are quinone intermediates in the ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) biosynthetic pathway that lack a methyl group at the C3 position of the benzoquinone ring while retaining the characteristic isoprenoid tail and other ring substituents. Structurally, they possess a 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone head group (rather than the 2,3,5-trimethoxy configuration of mature ubiquinone) attached to a polyprenyl side chain of species-specific length. These intermediates are generated through a series of hydroxylation and decarboxylation reactions on 4-hydroxybenzoate or para-aminobenzoate precursors, followed by O-methylation steps that sequentially add methoxy groups to the ring. The final methylation step, which converts 3-demethylubiquinone to ubiquinone, is catalyzed by the enzyme Coq3 (also known as UbiG in bacteria or COQ3 in eukaryotes), an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent O-methyltransferase. Coq3 specifically transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the C3 hydroxyl position of 3-demethylubiquinone, completing the methylation pattern required for full ubiquinone activity. This enzyme exhibits strict substrate specificity for the demethylated C3 position and is essential for producing the final ubiquinone molecule, which functions as a critical electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and possesses antioxidant properties. The methylation reaction represents the terminal step in establishing the redox potential and membrane localization properties characteristic of functional ubiquinone.",345,409,0.00717,True,47.77,"3-Demethylubiquinones are polyprenylbenzoquinones that serve as penultimate intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis, characterized by a 1,4-benzoquinone ring structure with a hydroxyl group at position 5, a methoxy group at position 2, and a variable-length polyisoprenoid side chain at position 6, but lacking the methyl group at position 3 that is present in the final ubiquinone product. Structurally, they belong to the class of monohydroxy-1,4-benzoquinones and retain the lipophilic polyprenyl tail that allows membrane association. The enzymatic conversion of 3-demethylubiquinones to ubiquinones is catalyzed by O-methyltransferases that transfer a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the C3 position of the benzoquinone ring. In prokaryotes, this reaction is performed by the UbiG enzyme, while in eukaryotes, the Coq3 protein (also called 3-demethylubiquinone-9 3-methyltransferase) carries out this function and is peripherally associated with the matrix-side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. These methyltransferases are remarkably versatile, as both UbiG and Coq3 have been demonstrated to catalyze both O-methylation steps in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway—not only the final methylation at position 3 to convert demethylubiquinone to ubiquinone, but also an earlier O-methylation step involving 3,4-dihydroxy-5-polyprenylbenzoate. The substrate for this final methylation step must be in the reduced hydroquinone form, which requires prior reduction by NADH-dependent reductases, and the reaction is essential for generating the fully methylated ubiquinone required for electron transport chain function.",28,1413,0.32987815,0.337048,"mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_molecule, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__ols__searchClasses",3,3,4,4,14,"Describes structural characteristics and enzymatic conversion reasonably well.

Mechanistically, the destruction complex—assembled by AXIN1 as scaffold, together with APC, CK1, and GSK3-beta—sequentially phosphorylates beta-catenin to mark it for proteasomal degradation; the phosphorylation of AXIN1 itself at T481, S486, and S493 enhances its stability within the complex and potentiates beta-catenin turnover, thereby maintaining the off-state of canonical Wnt signaling in the absence of Wnt ligand.

The human coenzyme A biosynthesis pathway, as curated in Reactome, comprises seven distinct biochemical reactions spanning four enzyme commission (EC) classes: transferases (EC 2.7, including both kinases at 2.7.1 and nucleotidyltransferases at 2.7.7), ligases (EC 6.3), and lyases (EC 4.1).

Documented subcellular localizations for these proteins reveal compartmentalization primarily between mitochondria (PANK2 predominantly localizes to mitochondria with some nuclear localization except during G2/M phase, while THIL is exclusively mitochondrial) and cytosol (COASY is mainly cytosolic and active in the cytosol, though also present in the mitochondrial matrix where it may anchor to the inner mitochondrial membrane). Five of these proteins are registered as ChEMBL drug targets: pantothenate kinases 1, 2, and 3 (CHEMBL3407326, CHEMBL3407327, and CHEMBL3407328), bifunctional coenzyme A synthase (CHEMBL4105867), and acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (CHEMBL2616).",60,4259,0.6187513000000001,0.62593,"mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__ols__fetch, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__togoid_convertId, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esummary, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",3,3,4,4,14,"Lists 5 reactions in 4 EC classes (ideal: 7 reactions, 3 EC classes).

question_050,choice,"Among Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which species has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records?

Choose one of the following options:
  - Klebsiella pneumoniae
  - Acinetobacter baumannii
  - Salmonella enterica
  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Salmonella enterica has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records, with 23 distinct classes, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16), and Acinetobacter baumannii (14). The 28 total unique classes across all four species (sum of per-species counts = 75; 75 > 28, indicating 47 class-instances are shared, with core classes such as BETA-LACTAM, AMINOGLYCOSIDE, QUINOLONE, TETRACYCLINE, and SULFONAMIDE present in all four species) reflects extensive horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants among Gram-negative pathogens. Salmonella enterica's broader drug-class repertoire is consistent with its diverse ecological niches spanning human clinical, livestock, and environmental reservoirs, which expose bacterial populations to a wide range of selective antibiotic pressures and facilitate acquisition of resistance genes from taxonomically distant organisms; distinctive Salmonella classes include BLEOMYCIN, STREPTOTHRICIN, RIFAMYCIN, FOSFOMYCIN, and GLYCOPEPTIDE. Notably, this class-breadth ranking diverges from gene-symbol diversity: K. pneumoniae has substantially more distinct gene symbols in AMRPortal but a narrower class range than Salmonella by just one class, reflecting K. pneumoniae's depth in a few resistance mechanisms (especially BETA-LACTAM diversity via ESBLs and carbapenemases) rather than breadth across classes. Acinetobacter baumannii, despite its clinical reputation as extensively drug-resistant, shows the fewest distinct drug classes (14) among the four ESKAPE pathogens in current surveillance records, as its resistance phenotype is largely driven by a concentrated set of OXA-type carbapenemases and efflux pump mechanisms rather than broad class diversification.
",True,7.19,"**Klebsiella pneumoniae** is correct.

Klebsiella pneumoniae has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records among these four species. This organism harbors resistance genes spanning the widest array of antibiotic classes, including beta-lactams (including carbapenems via various carbapenemases like KPC, NDM, OXA-48), aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, phenicols, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, fosfomycin, and colistin (mcr genes). K. pneumoniae's capacity to acquire and maintain diverse resistance determinants through mobile genetic elements, combined with its clinical significance as a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections, has made it a primary focus of genotypic surveillance efforts worldwide. While P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii are also highly resistant pathogens with multiple resistance mechanisms, and S. enterica shows resistance across several classes, K. pneumoniae consistently demonstrates resistance genes representing the broadest spectrum of antibiotic drug classes in surveillance databases, reflecting both its genetic plasticity and its role as a reservoir of resistance determinants in clinical settings.",289,271,0.004932,True,39.09,"**Salmonella enterica**
