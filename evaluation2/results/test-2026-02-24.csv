question_001,yes_no,Does the HSPB1 gene have pathogenic variants documented in ClinVar for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease?,"Yes, HSPB1 (heat shock protein family B (small) member 1, Gene ID 3315) has multiple pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants documented in ClinVar that are specifically linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F (CMT2F; MedGen C1847823), the HSPB1-associated axonal subtype of CMT. The exact count depends on the database snapshot; the RDF portal query returned 20 current records at time of query, while the live NCBI ClinVar release contains ≥66 such variants. Variants include missense substitutions affecting functionally critical residues in the alpha-crystallin domain (e.g., c.379C>T p.Arg127Trp, c.404C>T p.Ser135Phe, c.406C>T p.Arg136Trp, c.418C>G p.Arg140Gly, c.545C>T p.Pro182Leu), as well as frameshift and nonsense variants (e.g., c.109dup p.Arg37fs (Likely pathogenic), c.532G>T p.Glu178Ter (Likely pathogenic)). Several large deletions at the HSPB1 locus on chromosome 7q11.23 also appear in the dataset. CMT2F is an autosomal dominant axonal peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy characterised by distal muscle weakness, sensory loss, and reduced tendon reflexes with onset ranging from the first to sixth decade.
",True,7.15,"Yes, the HSPB1 gene has pathogenic variants documented in ClinVar for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. HSPB1 (Heat Shock Protein Family B Member 1) encodes a small heat shock protein also known as HSP27, and mutations in this gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F (CMT2F) and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 2B (dHMN2B). ClinVar contains multiple pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in HSPB1 associated with these peripheral neuropathy phenotypes, which are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The documented variants typically result in missense mutations that affect the protein's chaperone function and its ability to maintain cytoskeletal integrity in peripheral nerves. These mutations lead to progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, and reduced nerve conduction velocities characteristic of CMT disease. The pathogenic variants are classified based on clinical evidence, segregation data from affected families, functional studies, and their effects on protein structure and function.",True,33.79,"Yes, the HSPB1 gene has pathogenic variants documented in ClinVar for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

These pathogenic variants are specifically linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease axonal type 2F (CMT2F, OMIM 606595), also known as distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 2B. The variants include frameshift mutations, nonsense mutations, and missense changes that disrupt the function of HSPB1, which encodes heat shock protein beta-1 (HSP27), a molecular chaperone critical for neuronal maintenance.

question_004,summary,Summarize the distribution of melatonin biosynthesis enzymes across species and characterize their molecular functions and the chemical intermediates involved.,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are distributed across 16 species spanning three kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi), with 33 reviewed proteins in total. Mammals account for 14 proteins across 9 taxa, including two human paralogs (AANAT and ASMT), with coverage extending to mouse, rat, cattle, sheep, macaque, hamster, chimpanzee, and Mus musculus molossinus. Plants contribute 14 proteins from 4 taxa: Arabidopsis thaliana (4 proteins), Oryza sativa subsp. japonica (7 proteins, the most of any single organism), Oryza sativa subsp. indica (1 protein), and Zea mays (2 proteins). Additional representatives include two bird proteins in Gallus gallus, two insect proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, and one fungal protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The pathway proceeds through two enzymatic steps acting on distinct chemical intermediates: first, aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT, GO:0004059, a subclass of N-acetyltransferase activity) converts serotonin (CHEBI:28790, C10H12N2O) to N-acetylserotonin (CHEBI:17697, C12H14N2O2); then acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT, GO:0017096, a subclass of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity) converts N-acetylserotonin to melatonin (CHEBI:16796, C13H16N2O2). Exactly 17 proteins are annotated with AANAT activity and 16 with ASMT activity, with no overlap. This enzymatic conservation across evolutionarily distant taxa — from yeast to plants to mammals — indicates an ancient origin of the two-step melatonin biosynthesis mechanism, with the pathway starting from tryptophan (CHEBI:27897, C11H12N2O2) via serotonin as the upstream precursor.
",True,10.65,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are distributed across diverse taxa including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, fungi, bacteria, and unicellular eukaryotes, though the specific enzyme complement varies considerably among lineages. The canonical vertebrate pathway involves four sequential enzymatic steps beginning with tryptophan, which is converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), then decarboxylated to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Serotonin is subsequently acetylated to N-acetylserotonin by arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in vertebrates, which catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the amine group of serotonin. The final step converts N-acetylserotonin to melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) via O-methylation catalyzed by hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT, also called ASMT), which transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-methionine to the 5-hydroxyl position. In vertebrates, these enzymes are primarily expressed in the pineal gland, retina, and gastrointestinal tract, with AANAT showing marked circadian regulation. Non-vertebrate organisms often employ alternative pathways or enzyme variants; plants possess serotonin N-acetyltransferase and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase-like enzymes, while some invertebrates use arylalkylamines N-acetyltransferase homologs with broader substrate specificity. Certain bacteria and unicellular organisms synthesize melatonin through pathways that may bypass serotonin or utilize distinct methyltransferases, reflecting independent evolutionary origins of melatonin biosynthetic capacity across the tree of life.",True,100.15,"Now I have comprehensive information from the databases. Let me synthesize this into a complete answer:

Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are distributed across diverse eukaryotic lineages including animals, plants, and fungi, with the pathway predominantly found in metazoans and viridiplantae (green plants). The core biosynthetic pathway involves four key enzyme classes with distinct molecular functions: tryptophan 5-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.4), a tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan using molecular oxygen; aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28), a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that decarboxylates 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan to produce serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) with release of carbon dioxide; serotonin N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.87), which acetylates serotonin using acetyl-CoA as the acyl donor to form N-acetylserotonin; and acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.4), an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase that catalyzes the final O-methylation of N-acetylserotonin to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Among reviewed proteins, serotonin N-acetyltransferase shows the broadest distribution with 17 eukaryotic entries including representation in animals, plants, and fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), while tryptophan 5-hydroxylase is primarily restricted to metazoans with 14 characterized proteins spanning vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians) and invertebrates (Drosophila, Caenorhabditis). Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase occurs in 14 reviewed eukaryotic proteins distributed across both metazoans and plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa), with plants exhibiting multiple isoforms suggesting expanded functional diversification. The aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase family shows the widest phylogenetic distribution with 14 eukaryotic proteins and rare bacterial representation, reflecting its broader substrate specificity for various aromatic amino acids beyond the melatonin pathway. The sequential chemical transformations proceed through L-tryptophan → 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan → serotonin → N-acetylserotonin → melatonin, with cofactor requirements including tetrahydrobiopterin, pyridoxal phosphate, acetyl-CoA (with CoA release), and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (yielding S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine as byproduct), establishing this pathway as a metabolically integrated system connecting amino acid metabolism, one-carbon transfer reactions, and bioamine signaling across kingdoms.","mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_endpoints, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__ols__search, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__ols__fetch, mcp__ols__search, mcp__pubmed__search_articles",5,4,3,5,17,,4,4,3,5,16,"The evaluated answer provides comprehensive information about melatonin biosynthesis enzymes across species, including their molecular functions and chemical intermediates.

question_005,choice,"Among the following kinase groups — AGC, CAMK, CMGC, and TK — which has the greatest number of human protein targets with experimentally determined X-ray crystal structures deposited in the PDB?

Choose one of the following options:
  - AGC
  - CAMK

  - TK","TK (tyrosine kinases) has the greatest number of human protein targets with
PDB X-ray crystal structures, with 2,280 structures across 80 ChEMBL-classified
human targets. CMGC ranks second (1,539 structures, 58 targets), followed by
CAMK (734 structures, 65 targets) and AGC (422 structures, 59 targets).

TK dominates structural coverage because tyrosine kinases are the primary targets
in cancer drug discovery. The EGFR family alone (EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4) accounts
for hundreds of entries; BCR-ABL1 (P00519) has over 200 structures due to
imatinib-resistance studies; VEGFR2/KDR (P35968), ALK (Q9UM73), c-MET (P08581),
RET (P07949), FGFR1-4, and the SRC family kinases each contribute dozens to
hundreds of structures. The pharmaceutical industry's intense focus on TK
inhibitors for oncology has driven an outsized crystallographic effort relative
to the number of targets.

CMGC ranks second because it includes intensively studied targets: CDK2 (P24941)
alone has over 400 PDB structures from fragment-based and structure-based drug
design campaigns; CDK4/6 (cyclin-dependent kinases), CDK8, CDK9, MAPK1/ERK2
(P28482), MAPK14/p38α (Q16539), GSK3B (P49841), and DYRK1A (Q13627) are all
major drug targets with large structural datasets.

CAMK ranks third despite having the most targets (65) among the four groups,
because many CAMK members (e.g., CaM kinases, DAPK, CHK1, CHK2) are less
pharmacologically tractable or have been structurally solved fewer times.

AGC ranks last (422 structures) despite its prominent members (AKT1/2/3, PKCα,
PKA, RSK1-4, S6K1) because several AGC kinases proved challenging for structural
biology due to flexibility or membrane association, and the group has fewer
members overall.

A note on cross-group overlap: 70 PDB structures (1.4%) contain proteins with
dual classification in ChEMBL (6 proteins annotated as both AGC and CAMK). These
structures are counted in both groups' totals. This overlap does not affect the
answer — TK leads CMGC by 741 structures, far exceeding the 70-structure overlap.

Three crystal structures are deposited in PDB: 8YAB, 8YAD, and 8YAH, representing different domains or conformations of the protein. The MANE Select flag indicates this transcript is the highest-quality representative isoform chosen through collaboration between NCBI and Ensembl, making it the preferred reference for clinical reporting and functional studies.

SPG11 encodes spatacsin, a large protein of approximately 2,443 amino acids that is part of the AP-5 adaptor complex involved in lysosomal trafficking and autophagy. The lack of experimental structures is likely due to the protein's large size and complex domain architecture, which pose significant technical challenges for structural biology techniques such as X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy.

question_009,list,Which human enzymes with catalytic roles in the leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway are documented drug targets in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records?,"Five of the eight human enzymes with catalytic roles in the Reactome leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway have mechanism-of-action records in ChEMBL. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, CHEMBL215) has the most ChEMBL mechanism records of any pathway enzyme, with eight drugs documented as inhibitors, including zileuton (phase 4), the only FDA-approved drug specifically indicated for asthma that acts by reversibly inhibiting this rate-limiting step in leukotriene synthesis, as well as five other phase-4 anti-inflammatory agents (mesalamine, sulfasalazine, balsalazide disodium, olsalazine sodium, meclofenamate sodium) and two phase-2 clinical candidates (PF-4191834, atreleuton). The 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP/FLAP, CHEMBL4550) is the most clinically active target, with three distinct phase-3 clinical inhibitors — fiboflapon, fiboflapon sodium, and veliflapon — all documented as INHIBITOR mechanisms. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H, CHEMBL4618), which converts LTA4 to the potent chemoattractant LTB4, is targeted by acebilustat at phase 2. The multidrug resistance-associated protein ABCC1/MRP1 (CHEMBL3004), which exports LTC4 across the cell membrane as part of the pathway, is targeted by the phase-2 multidrug resistance modulator biricodar. MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2, CHEMBL2208), which activates ALOX5 via phosphorylation, is targeted at phase 1 by AT-13148, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor. Three pathway enzymes — arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1), and leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) — lack ChEMBL mechanism records despite participating in the pathway, reflecting their lower prioritisation as drug targets in clinical development programmes.
",True,10.06,"In the leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathways, several human enzymes serve as documented drug targets in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records. ALOX5 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) catalyzes the first committed step in leukotriene synthesis, converting arachidonic acid to leukotriene A4, and is targeted by zileuton, a direct enzyme inhibitor approved for asthma treatment. LTA4H (leukotriene A4 hydrolase) converts leukotriene A4 to the pro-inflammatory leukotriene B4 and has documented inhibitors in ChEMBL development programs. LTC4S (leukotriene C4 synthase) conjugates leukotriene A4 with glutathione to form leukotriene C4, initiating the cysteinyl leukotriene pathway, though inhibitors remain primarily in preclinical stages. ALOX15 (arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase) catalyzes the formation of 15-HETE, a precursor in eoxin biosynthesis, and appears in ChEMBL with various inhibitor records. Additionally, downstream enzymes like GGT1 (gamma-glutamyltransferase 1) and DPEP1/DPEP2 (dipeptidases) that sequentially convert leukotriene C4 to leukotriene D4 and E4 have associated ChEMBL entries, though they are less frequently targeted therapeutically compared to the upstream synthetic enzymes.

2. **LTA4H** - hydrolyzes LTA4 to LTB4  
3. **LTC4S** - converts LTA4 to LTC4 (and EXA4 to EXC4)
4. **ALOX15** - converts LTA4 to EXA4 (eoxin pathway)
5. **GGT** (GGT1/GGT5) - hydrolyzes LTC4 to LTD4 (and EXC4 to EXD4)

question_010,choice,"Which parent disease category of systemic lupus erythematosus has the most diseases with confirmed MeSH TopicalDescriptor mappings?

Choose one of the following options:
  - immune system disorder

  - rheumatic disorder","Immune system disorder (MONDO:0005046) has the most diseases with confirmed MeSH TopicalDescriptor mappings among the four parent categories of systemic lupus erythematosus, with 248 confirmed MeSH TopicalDescriptors across its disease subclasses. This substantially exceeds connective tissue disorder (134 TopicalDescriptors), autoimmune disease (61 TopicalDescriptors), and rheumatic disorder (39 TopicalDescriptors). The counts reflect confirmed joins with the MeSH RDF graph restricted to meshv:TopicalDescriptor entries (i.e., canonical MeSH headings used for indexing); MONDO cross-references to MeSH supplementary concept records (MESH:C...) are excluded. The four categories are not mutually exclusive: immune system disorder is the broadest and contains the other three as subcategories, so their diseases are counted within it as well — the sum across categories (482) exceeds the 346 unique diseases with TopicalDescriptor mappings due to this intentional overlap in the ontology hierarchy. The higher absolute count for immune system disorder reflects its greater scope rather than a higher per-disease mapping rate, since autoimmune disease and rheumatic disorder actually have proportionally good coverage relative to their size.
",True,7.05,"The correct answer is **autoimmune disease**.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) belongs to multiple parent disease categories in medical classification systems, including autoimmune diseases, connective tissue disorders, immune system disorders, and rheumatic disorders.

This category includes numerous conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, celiac disease, and many others - each with confirmed MeSH descriptors. While connective tissue disorders and rheumatic disorders are also relevant parent categories for SLE, they represent more anatomically or symptomatically defined groupings that contain fewer distinct disease entities compared to the mechanistically defined autoimmune disease category. The autoimmune disease category's breadth, encompassing conditions affecting virtually every organ system united by the common pathophysiologic mechanism of immune system self-reactivity, results in the largest number of diseases with confirmed MeSH TopicalDescriptor mappings among the listed options.",True,59.44,"Perfect!

The Rhea database documents these biochemical reactions by linking them to chemical entities in ChEBI. Querying Rhea reactions whose equation text mentions ""chlorophyll"" or ""bacteriochlorophyll"" and extracting their associated ChEBI compound identifiers (via the rh:chebi property) yields 64 unique ChEBI chemical entities involved in these pathways. These ChEBI classes serve as type annotations for PubChem compound entries (via rdf:type assertions), enabling cross-database integration. Filtering for PubChem compounds (those with URIs starting with ""http://rdf.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/compound/"") that are typed by any of these 64 ChEBI classes yields 24 distinct compounds. These include central pathway intermediates such as protoporphyrinogen IX, Mg-protoporphyrin IX, and various chlorophyllide derivatives, as well as cofactors like NADPH, ATP, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The substantially smaller number of PubChem entries relative to ChEBI classes reflects the fact that many highly specific tetrapyrrole intermediates and bacteriochlorophyll precursors, though well-defined in ChEBI, do not yet have curated entries in PubChem.

Enzymatically, two late proteins break the ""purely structural"" expectation: gp5 (NEEDL_BPT4) bears lysozyme activity (GO:0003796) that hydrolyzes peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall to puncture the host envelope during injection, while the uvsW DNA helicases (GO:0043138, 3'-5' DNA helicase activity) drive late-phase recombination and repair, a function unusual for proteins expressed after DNA replication has begun. Of the 25 proteins, 17 (68%) are structurally characterized in PDB via at least one entry, yielding 149 distinct structures (103 by cryo-electron microscopy, 44 by X-ray crystallography, 2 by solution NMR); because T4 assemblies are large multi-subunit complexes—the baseplate alone contains 11 late proteins—the same PDB entry frequently references multiple T4 proteins, producing 182 total protein-to-entry attributions for 149 distinct structures (33 attribution counts arise from co-occurrence in assemblies). The striking dominance of cryo-EM (69% of entries) reflects the field's shift toward studying intact viral assemblies: fibritin alone accounts for 104 of these entries due to its adoption as an engineering scaffold, while the gp5 spike (18 entries) and major capsid protein (9 entries) follow; the eight structurally uncharacterized proteins—most notably the three baseplate hub proteins gp26, gp28, and gp51, the two long tail-fiber subunits gp35 and gp36, and the two uvsW helicase isoforms—represent current frontiers in T4 structural biology.
",True,10.3,"The late structural proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 are organized into three primary functional modules: the capsid assembly complex (including major head protein gp23, vertex protein gp24, portal protein gp20, and head completion proteins gp13, gp14, and others), the baseplate structure (comprising at least 15 distinct proteins including gp5, gp6, gp7, gp8, gp9, gp10, gp11, gp25, gp27, gp48, and gp53), and the tail apparatus (featuring major tail tube protein gp19, tail sheath protein gp18, tail terminator proteins, and tail fibers gp34, gp35, gp36, and gp37). Despite their structural roles, several of these late proteins possess enzymatic activities: gp5 contains lysozyme activity for cell wall degradation during infection, the long tail fibers (gp34, gp37) exhibit endorhamnosidase activity for host receptor binding, and gp16 functions as a terminase with ATPase and endonuclease activities for DNA packaging. Structural characterization of T4 late proteins shows extensive coverage through both X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, with early high-resolution structures of individual proteins (gp23, gp24, baseplate components) predominantly solved by X-ray crystallography, while more recent comprehensive structural analysis of the assembled virion, including the complete baseplate in different conformational states and the entire capsid-tail assembly at near-atomic resolution, derives primarily from cryo-EM reconstructions that reveal the intricate architectural organization and conformational dynamics of these multiprotein complexes in situ.",True,95.29,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me compile the final answer based on my findings:

The reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 encompass 38 distinct structural proteins that are functionally organized into three major GO-annotated modules: capsid components (major capsid protein gp23, capsid vertex protein gp24, small outer capsid protein Soc, highly immunogenic outer capsid protein Hoc, capsid assembly protein gp31, scaffolding protein, and prohead core protease gp21), baseplate components (central hub proteins gp26, gp28, gp51; wedge proteins gp6, gp7, gp8, gp9, gp10, gp11, gp25, gp53; central spike complex proteins gp5 and gp27; puncturing device gp5.4; and tail-tube junction proteins gp48 and gp54), and tail components (tail sheath protein gp18, tail tube protein gp19, tail tube terminator protein gp3, tail fiber proteins including long-tail fibers gp34, gp35, gp36, gp37 and their proximal subunit, short tail fiber gp12, tail fiber assembly proteins, and tail completion protein gp15). Despite their predominantly structural roles, several late proteins encode enzymatic activities including the prohead core protease gp21 with serine-type peptidase activity (EC 3.4.21.-), the pre-baseplate central spike protein gp5 with lysozyme activity (EC 3.2.1.17) for peptidoglycan degradation, the baseplate puncturing device gp5.4 with peptidoglycan beta-N-acetylmuramidase activity, the head completion nuclease with both endonuclease and exonuclease activities (EC 3.1.-.-), and the capsid assembly protein gp31 possessing ATP-binding and chaperone functions. Experimental structural coverage of these late proteins is extensive, with 67 unique PDB depositions spanning 26 different T4 late proteins (68% of the reviewed late structural proteins), distributed relatively evenly between X-ray crystallography (39 structures, 58%) and cryo-electron microscopy (28 structures, 42%), with notable representation including multiple structures of the major capsid protein gp23, extensive coverage of baseplate wedge proteins, 18 structures of the enzymatic gp5 central spike protein, and comprehensive cryo-EM reconstructions of the complete baseplate assembly (5IV5, 5IV7) alongside high-resolution X-ray structures of individual protein domains.","mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_endpoints, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",5,4,3,5,17,"The evaluated answer contains all necessary information from the ideal answer, including functional module assignments, enzymatic activities, and structural coverage.

  - Pseudomonadales","Hyphomicrobiales has the highest number of nitrogenase structural genes (nifH and nifD) among the four orders, with 66 annotated genes across 27 sequenced organisms in the NCBI Gene database. This order, which includes well-studied nitrogen-fixing alpha-proteobacteria such as Rhizobium phaseoli (6 genes), Rhodopseudomonas palustris (4 genes), and Xanthobacter autotrophicus (4 genes), is the predominant source of characterized nitrogenase genes in current genomic databases, reflecting decades of genome sequencing focused on agriculturally important symbiotic and free-living diazotrophs. Eubacteriales (formerly Clostridiales) ranks second with 19 nifH/nifD genes from 8 organisms, including Clostridium pasteurianum DSM 525 (7 genes) as the dominant contributor, alongside other anaerobic nitrogen fixers such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum (3 genes) and Clostridium beijerinckii (2 genes). Burkholderiales has 11 genes from 5 organisms including the endophyte Herbaspirillum seropedicae, while Pseudomonadales has only 7 genes from 2 organisms, notably Azotobacter chroococcum. The dominance of Hyphomicrobiales (66 genes, 64% of the 103 genes in these four orders) reflects the extensive genome sequencing of alpha-proteobacterial diazotrophs and the multiple nifH/nifD paralogs retained in some of these organisms. Across the full NCBI Gene database, 375 nifH/nifD genes span 174 organisms, demonstrating that nitrogen fixation capability is phylogenetically scattered well beyond these four orders, including in diverse Archaea (e.g., Methanocaldococcus) and sulfate-reducing bacteria.
",True,8.14,"**Burkholderiales** is the correct answer.

Burkholderiales has the highest representation of nitrogenase structural genes (nifH and nifD) in the NCBI Gene database among these four orders. This order contains numerous well-characterized nitrogen-fixing bacteria, particularly within families like Burkholderiaceae and Rhodocyclaceae. Notable nitrogen-fixing genera include *Burkholderia*, *Paraburkholderia*, *Cupriavidus* (formerly *Ralstonia*), and *Herbaspirillum*, many of which are important plant-associated diazotrophs or free-living nitrogen fixers. While Hyphomicrobiales also contains significant nitrogen-fixing capacity (including rhizobia like *Rhizobium*, *Bradyrhizobium*, and *Sinorhizobium*), Burkholderiales encompasses a broader diversity of diazotrophic lineages with extensive nif gene cluster representation. Pseudomonadales has limited nitrogen-fixing capability, with only select species possessing functional nitrogenase systems. Eubacteriales (an older taxonomic designation that included various firmicutes) has relatively fewer characterized nitrogen-fixing representatives compared to the proteobacterial orders, though some members like certain *Clostridium* species are nitrogen fixers.",True,22.38,"**Correct answer: Hyphomicrobiales**

Hyphomicrobiales has the highest number of nitrogenase structural genes represented in the NCBI Gene database with 263 total nifH or nifD gene entries, substantially exceeding the other orders examined. Eubacteriales ranks second with 67 genes, followed by Burkholderiales with 58 genes, and Pseudomonadales with only 22 genes. The predominance of nitrogen fixation genes in Hyphomicrobiales reflects the well-established capacity for biological nitrogen fixation in this order of Alphaproteobacteria, which includes many agriculturally important symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as rhizobia that form nodules on legume roots, as well as free-living nitrogen-fixing genera like Rhodopseudomonas and Bradyrhizobium. The relatively lower numbers in Burkholderiales and Pseudomonadales, despite these orders also containing known diazotrophs, indicate that nitrogen fixation is less widespread or less extensively sequenced in these groups, while the modest representation in Eubacteriales (Bacillales in modern taxonomy) reflects the presence of some nitrogen-fixing Clostridiales and related genera within this grouping.","mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch",5,4,3,4,16,"The evaluated answer correctly identifies Burkholderiales as having the highest number of nitrogenase structural genes (nifH or nifD) represented in the NCBI Gene database.

DSM 101043 (BacDive ID 131407) is documented to grow in Cyanobacteria Medium BG11-, which is a nitrogen-free medium used to induce heterocyst formation in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. A MediaDive query confirmed zero nitrogen-containing ingredients (no nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, or urea) in BG11-, establishing that the strain grows without any external fixed-nitrogen source. BG11- medium lacks fixed nitrogen sources, requiring nitrogen-fixing strains like Anabaena to form specialized heterocyst cells for atmospheric nitrogen fixation. This psychrophilic strain isolated from sediment can fix atmospheric nitrogen through the nitrogenase enzyme complex housed within heterocysts, specialized anaerobic cells that protect oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase from photosynthetic oxygen production. The cross-database integration between BacDive (strain characterization) and MediaDive (validated cultivation protocols) confirms this nitrogen-independent growth capability.
",True,6.49,"Anabaena sp. DSM 101043, like other Anabaena species, is capable of growing in nitrogen-free BG11⁻ medium (also written as BG11₀ or BG11-N). This cyanobacterium is a diazotrophic organism that can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) through the action of the nitrogenase enzyme complex located in specialized cells called heterocysts. When grown in the absence of combined nitrogen sources such as nitrate or ammonium, Anabaena species differentiate heterocysts along their filaments, which provide an anaerobic environment suitable for nitrogen fixation. The BG11⁻ medium is specifically formulated as a nitrogen-depleted variant of standard BG11 medium, omitting sodium nitrate while retaining other essential nutrients, and is routinely used to culture diazotrophic cyanobacteria and induce heterocyst formation.

The predominance of mupA in surveillance records reflects its plasmid-mediated transmissibility, which facilitates its spread among clinical MRSA lineages, whereas ileS mutations arise independently and are less common. The distinction between high-level (mupA) and low-level (ileS mutations) resistance has direct clinical implications, as high-level resistance compromises mupirocin use for MRSA decolonization regimens.

question_020,yes_no,Does the bacterial genome assembly CP036276.1 of Symmachiella dynata strain Mal52 encode more than one copy of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene?,"The bacterial genome assembly CP036276.1 of Symmachiella dynata strain Mal52 encodes two copies of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The first copy is located at positions 436,264–437,809 bp on the forward strand, and the second copy at positions 5,256,596–5,258,141 bp on the reverse strand. Together with a 23S ribosomal RNA gene (1,040,576–1,043,484 bp) and a 5S ribosomal RNA gene (1,043,659–1,043,768 bp), the genome harbors four ribosomal RNA features in total. The spatial arrangement of the 23S and 5S rRNA genes adjacent to the first 16S copy suggests that these three form a classical prokaryotic rRNA operon (16S-23S-5S), while the second 16S copy at a distant locus may represent an incomplete or independent operon. The presence of multiple 16S rRNA gene copies is commonly associated with the capacity for faster ribosome production and more rapid adaptation to nutrient availability, as rRNA gene copy number correlates with maximum growth rate in bacteria. This structural information is retrievable directly from the INSDC nucleotide sequence record via the DDBJ RDF endpoint, with features linked to NCBI Taxonomy identifier 2527995 through the RO:in taxon relationship.
",True,5.95,"I cannot provide specific information about the bacterial genome assembly CP036276.1 of Symmachiella dynata strain Mal52, as this requires access to genome annotation databases such as NCBI GenBank or similar resources that contain detailed information about this particular assembly. Determining the exact number of 16S ribosomal RNA gene copies encoded in a specific genome assembly requires querying the genomic sequence data and its associated annotations, which is beyond my training knowledge. Generally, bacterial genomes typically contain between 1 and 15 copies of the 16S rRNA gene, with most species having multiple copies to support the high demand for ribosomal RNA in protein synthesis, but the specific copy number varies considerably among different bacterial taxa and must be determined empirically for each genome assembly.",True,50.82,"Perfect!

When distributed across eight GO cellular component subcategories using structured ontology IRIs, 49 of these proteins are annotated to the general proteasome complex (GO:0000502), while the 20S core complex (GO:0005839) accounts for 18 proteins, the accessory complex (GO:0022624) for 16, the core beta-subunit complex (GO:0019774) for 11, the regulatory particle base subcomplex (GO:0008540) for 9, the lid subcomplex (GO:0008541) for 8, the alpha-subunit complex (GO:0019773) for 8, and the 19S regulatory particle (GO:0005838) for 7. The sum of these category counts reaches 126 annotations for 52 uniquely annotated proteins (arithmetic verification: 126 > 52 = valid overlap), reflecting extensive multi-subcomplex co-annotation — for example, a beta subunit is simultaneously annotated to the general proteasome complex, the 20S core, and the beta-subunit complex. Four proteins lack the general GO:0000502 annotation entirely: PSMF1 (PI31 inhibitor), PSME4 (PA200 activator), PSB11 (inducible beta-11), and PSMA8 (testis-specific alpha-8). Three of them (PSMF1, PSB11, PSMA8) still appear in subcomplex categories (GO:0005839, GO:0019774, GO:0019773 respectively), while PSME4 carries none of the eight GO subcomplex annotations, consistent with its role as an externally docking activator rather than a structural subunit. Cross-referencing with ChEMBL reveals that 22 of the 53 proteins (41.5%) are registered as human single-protein drug targets, with all eight canonical beta subunits included — consistent with the clinical use of proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib that target the beta5 catalytic subunit (PSMB5).
",True,10.33,"The human proteasome protein landscape defined by UniProt keyword KW-0647 comprises approximately 45-50 proteins that collectively form the proteasome complex responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation.

Accessory proteins and proteasome-interacting factors account for an additional 15-20 proteins, including PA28 activator subunits (PSME1-4), PA200 (PSME4), and various assembly chaperones and proteasome regulators. Multi-subcomplex annotations show minimal overlap since most subunits have dedicated structural roles within either the 20S core or 19S regulatory particle, though some regulatory proteins like PSME3 can associate with multiple proteasome forms. Regarding therapeutic relevance, approximately 15-20% of proteasome proteins are represented as ChEMBL drug targets, with the catalytic beta subunits PSMB5, PSMB8, and PSMB10 being the primary targets for FDA-approved proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib used in multiple myeloma treatment, while other subunits remain largely unexploited therapeutically despite their essential cellular functions.",True,88.96,"Perfect!

The 20S core complex comprises 17 proteins, subdivided into 8 alpha-subunit components (PSA1-7, PSMA8) and 9 beta-subunit components (PSB1-11), representing the catalytic core particle responsible for proteolytic activity. The 19S regulatory particle contains 19 proteins split between the base subcomplex with 6 AAA-ATPase components (PRS4, PRS6A/B, PRS7, PRS8, PRS10) and 2 non-ATPase proteins (PSMD1, PSMD2, PSMD4), and the lid subcomplex with 9 non-ATPase regulatory proteins (PSD11, PSD12, PSD13, PSDE, PSMD3, PSMD6, PSMD7, PSMD8, SEM1, ADRM1). Accessory and regulatory proteins account for 18 additional components, including proteasome activators (PSME1-4), assembly chaperones (PSMF1, PAAF1, ECM29), ubiquitin receptors (RD23A/B), deubiquitinases (UCHL5, UBP14), and other modulators (TXNL1, UBE3A, UBE3C, UBQL1).

The specific list of proteins meeting these criteria would depend on the current state of both databases at the time of query, including recent curation decisions, new protein discoveries associated with spinocerebellar ataxias, and updates to MANE Select transcript assignments.

This substantial variant burden reflects KCNQ2's role as the causal gene for both the severe DEE7 (developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 7, MONDO:0013387) and the milder benign familial neonatal convulsions type 1, making it a major target of clinical sequencing in pediatric epilepsy. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 encode the Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits that co-assemble to form the neuronal M-channel responsible for regulating neuronal excitability; KCNQ2 variants are more frequently pathogenic and more clinically diverse in severity than KCNQ3 variants, which mainly cause the milder BFNC2 (MONDO:0007366). KCNT1 encodes the sodium-activated KNa1.1 (SLACK) channel and causes the severe epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS, MONDO:0100025), while KCNB1 encodes the Kv2.1 delayed-rectifier channel associated with DEE34 (MONDO:0014718); both have a smaller but clinically significant variant spectrum compared to KCNQ2.
",True,7.97,"**KCNQ2** is correct.

KCNQ2 has the greatest number of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants documented in ClinVar among these four voltage-gated potassium channel genes. This gene is associated with benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS) and KCNQ2-related epileptic encephalopathy, conditions that have been extensively studied since the gene's identification in the 1990s. The high variant count reflects both the gene's relatively early discovery and clinical implementation of genetic testing, as well as its association with a spectrum of seizure disorders ranging from self-limited familial neonatal epilepsy to severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. KCNQ2 encodes the Kv7.2 subunit that forms M-current channels critical for neuronal excitability regulation, and loss-of-function variants are well-established causes of neonatal-onset epilepsy. While KCNQ3, KCNB1, and KCNT1 are also established epilepsy genes, they have fewer documented pathogenic variants in ClinVar, partly due to later gene-disease associations or lower overall disease prevalence compared to KCNQ2-related disorders.",True,23.97,"**KCNQ2** is the correct answer.

KCNQ2 has 1,008 pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants documented in ClinVar, substantially exceeding the other three voltage-gated potassium channel genes: KCNT1 has 280 variants, KCNQ3 has 255 variants, and KCNB1 has 213 variants. These genes encode subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels critical for neuronal excitability and are each associated with distinct epilepsy syndromes under the epilepsy disease class MONDO:0005027. KCNQ2 encodes the Kv7.2 channel subunit and is primarily associated with benign familial neonatal seizures and early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, conditions that are among the most extensively studied channelopathies. The substantially higher number of documented pathogenic variants in KCNQ2 reflects both the gene's critical role in neonatal and infantile epilepsies and the extensive clinical and genetic screening conducted for KCNQ2-related disorders over the past two decades, making it one of the most comprehensively characterized epilepsy genes in terms of variant pathogenicity.","mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch",5,5,5,5,20,"The evaluated answer accurately recalls all key information from the ideal reference, including the gene with the greatest number of pathogenic variants in ClinVar.

question_026,yes_no,"Is 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine classified in PubChem as a pteridine (CHEBI:17601) and documented as a substrate in an approved Rhea reaction catalyzed by riboflavin synthase (EC 2.5.1.9)?","Yes. 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine is classified in PubChem as the pteridine CHEBI:17601 (CID:168989), and its pH-7.3 microspecies (CHEBI:58201, CID:46931117) is documented as the direct substrate of the approved Rhea reaction RHEA:20772 catalyzed by riboflavin synthase (EC 2.5.1.9). In this reaction, two molecules of the lumazine intermediate undergo a dismutation: one is oxidized to release the four-carbon fragment that becomes the dimethylbenzene ring of riboflavin, while the other is reduced back to 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil, an earlier precursor in the riboflavin pathway. The reaction is chemically balanced, Approved in Rhea, and annotated with GO:0004746 (riboflavin synthase activity). The pteridine scaffold of the lumazine substrate is thus the direct biosynthetic precursor to the isoalloxazine ring system of riboflavin (vitamin B2).
",True,7.61,"6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine is classified in PubChem as a pteridine derivative, consistent with its structural classification under CHEBI:17601, as lumazines are pteridine compounds featuring a pyrimido[4,5-b]pyrazine ring system. This compound serves as a documented substrate in Rhea-catalyzed reactions involving riboflavin synthase (EC 2.5.1.9), which catalyzes the final step of riboflavin biosynthesis. Specifically, riboflavin synthase catalyzes the dismutation reaction where two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine are converted into one molecule of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and one molecule of 5-amino-6-(1-D-ribitylamino)uracil. This reaction is essential in the biosynthetic pathway of riboflavin in bacteria, fungi, and plants, making 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine a critical intermediate in flavin cofactor biosynthesis.

question_027,factoid,How many distinct approved biochemical reactions in the Rhea database are collectively annotated for the reviewed human enzymatic catalysts of the nicotinate metabolism pathway?,"The 22 reviewed human enzymatic catalysts of the Reactome nicotinate metabolism pathway are collectively annotated with 58 distinct approved reactions in the Rhea database. This repertoire encompasses the full biochemical breadth of these enzymes beyond their nicotinate-specific roles: the pathway itself covers the Preiss-Handler route (nicotinate → NaMN → deamido-NAD+ → NAD+ via NAPRT, NMNAT1-3, and NADSYN1), the NAD+ salvage route (nicotinamide → NMN → NAD+ via NAMPT and NMNATs), and NAD+ consumption and recycling steps (CD38/BST1 glycohydrolases, NNMT methyltransferase, NT5E nucleotidase). The per-enzyme Rhea contribution varies widely: the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SLC5A8 (Q8N695) links to 14 approved reactions reflecting its broad substrate range for short-chain carboxylates including nicotinate, while NT5E/CD73 (P21589) contributes 10 reactions covering all its nucleoside monophosphate substrates. CD38 (P28907) accounts for 6 reactions including NAD+ glycohydrolase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, and cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase activities. The 58-reaction total from 22 enzymes (68 protein-reaction pairs) reflects 10 shared reactions catalysed by multiple enzyme paralogues — for instance, the core NAD+ glycohydrolase reaction (Rhea:16301) is shared by both CD38 and BST1/CD157. In contrast, NAMPT, NADK, NAPRT, QPRT, and NNMT each contribute a single Rhea reaction reflecting their narrow substrate specificity, while NMNAT1 (Q9HAN9) contributes 2 approved reactions — covering both NMN (Rhea:21360) and NaMN (Rhea:22860) as substrates — consistent with its dual role in both the salvage and Preiss-Handler de novo routes to NAD+.

",True,7.44,"Chromosome 1 is correct.

Chromosome 1 contains the greatest number of distinct protein-coding genes annotated with cardiomyopathy among the options listed.

question_031,factoid,How many distinct approved Rhea biochemical reactions are catalyzed by reviewed human glycosyltransferases?,"There are 128 distinct approved Rhea biochemical reactions catalyzed by reviewed human glycosyltransferases. These enzymes, annotated in Swiss-Prot with keyword KW-0328, collectively carry 105 distinct EC number entries in UniProt, of which 98 are fully-specified (non-wildcard) assignments and 7 are partial sub-class codes (e.g., 2.4.-.-) that Rhea does not carry. The 98 specific ECs span primarily the four canonical glycosyltransferase sub-classes — hexosyltransferases (EC 2.4.1.x, the largest group), pentosyltransferases (EC 2.4.2.x), N-acylneuraminyltransferases (EC 2.4.3.x), and sialyltransferases (EC 2.4.99.x) — plus additional enzyme activities present in proteins tagged with KW-0328: an acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.286), a phosphotransferase/lipid metabolism enzyme (EC 2.7.8.15), and two glycoside hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.45 and EC 3.2.1.46). The 128 Rhea master reactions cover a broad range of sugar-transfer chemistries, including O-glycan and N-glycan elongation, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, proteoglycan assembly, GPI-anchor remodelling, ADP-ribosylation, and nucleotide-sugar metabolism, reflecting the diverse cellular roles of human glycosyltransferases in development, immunity, and signalling. The count is derived by cross-linking the EC number IRIs shared between UniProt protein records and Rhea reaction annotations; proteins annotated only with partial EC codes do not contribute, as Rhea carries only fully resolved EC assignments.
",True,8.38,"I cannot provide a specific number for the distinct approved Rhea biochemical reactions catalyzed by reviewed human glycosyltransferases because this would require accessing current databases including Rhea (the expert-curated knowledgebase of biochemical reactions), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (for reviewed human proteins), and their cross-references.

These enzymes, classified under EC 2.4 (glycosyltransferases), transfer glycosyl groups from donor molecules to acceptor molecules in diverse biochemical processes. The 248 reviewed human proteins with glycosyltransferase activity span 106 different EC numbers, collectively accounting for approximately 27% of the 505 approved glycosyltransferase reactions documented in Rhea across all organisms.

The remaining 18 genera either lack BacDive oxygen tolerance records entirely (11 genera including Cyanobacteria such as Nostoc, Synechococcus, Microcystis, and Planktothrix, which are oxygenic phototrophs, as well as non-cyanobacterial genera Dactylococcopsis, Dolichospermum, Haloquadratum, Koribacter, Microchaete, Pseudanabaena, and Spirulina) or have BacDive oxygen tolerance records but no strictly anaerobic strains (Ancylobacter and Bradyrhizobium are exclusively aerobic or obligate aerobic; Haloferax, Halorubrum, and Priestia are exclusively aerobic or obligate aerobic; Halobacterium has one facultative anaerobe strain alongside aerobic strains; and Mycobacterium has 9 facultative anaerobe and 101 microaerophile strains alongside its 214 aerobic or obligate aerobic strains). The anaerobic genera span three physiologically distinct groups: Cereibacter and Thiocapsa are anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (purple non-sulfur and purple sulfur, respectively) that use light energy in the absence of oxygen, and their gas vesicles enable buoyancy positioning in stratified anoxic water columns below the oxycline; Geotalea (a genus closely allied to Geobacter) is a sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacterium that couples anaerobic respiration to metal reduction, with gas vesicles reported in at least one species; and the single anaerobic Streptomyces strain is exceptional within a genus overwhelmingly composed of aerobes (193 aerobic and 64 obligate-aerobic strains in BacDive, alongside 6 facultative anaerobes and 4 microaerophiles). This distribution demonstrates that gas vesicle formation is not restricted to aerobic or oxygenic lineages and has been co-opted in anoxic ecological niches — meromictic lakes, stratified fjords, and sulfidic sediments — where buoyancy regulation provides positional advantage in chemoclines rather than in oxygenated photic zones.

The remaining 1,112 records (12.7%) have no resistancePhenotype value. Arithmetic verification: 2390 + 5255 + 13 + 1112 = 8,770 ✓. The most frequently resistant bacterial species are Escherichia coli (853 resistant isolates), Shigella sonnei (729), Salmonella enterica (334), Klebsiella pneumoniae (220), and Shigella flexneri (150); Staphylococcus aureus (33) and Enterococcus faecium also contribute. Taxonomically, the dominant resistant organisms—E. coli, Shigella, Klebsiella, and Salmonella—all belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria, whereas Staphylococcus aureus (family Staphylococcaceae) and Enterococcus faecium (family Enterococcaceae) represent Firmicutes exceptions. Genotypically, AMRportal contains 25,236 TRIMETHOPRIM-class resistance features; the predominant gene family is dhfrI with multiple allelic variants (dhfrI_1: 3,855; dhfrI_2: 3,851; dhfrI: 2,784; dhfrI_3–7: additional records totaling ~11,583), followed by folA variants (~1,873), dfrD variants (~1,032), and dfrA variants (~520)—all encoding dihydrofolate reductase (NCBI Gene: folA described as ""dihydrofolate reductase""; dfrA as ""dihydrofolate reductase""), the enzyme target of trimethoprim that inhibits bacterial tetrahydrofolate synthesis. Among the 2,073 geographically annotated resistant isolates, Europe shows the highest burden (823), followed by Oceania (698), Asia (392), Africa (118), and the Americas (42), a distribution that reflects global surveillance intensity and the concentration of large-scale clinical monitoring programs in Europe and Australasia.
",True,9.97,"Trimethoprim resistance is most pronounced in Enterobacteriaceae species, particularly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella species, as well as in Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcaceae) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Streptococcaceae), with these organisms consistently demonstrating high minimum inhibitory concentrations that exceed clinical breakpoints. The predominant resistance mechanisms involve the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene families, designated dfr genes, which encode altered DHFR enzymes with reduced affinity for trimethoprim while maintaining catalytic function in folate metabolism; major variants include dfrA genes (common in Gram-negative bacteria with over 30 subtypes), dfrB genes (primarily in Gram-positive organisms), and dfrG genes, along with chromosomal mutations in the folA gene that produce DHFR variants with structural changes preventing drug binding. Geographic distribution reveals widespread global dissemination of trimethoprim resistance, with particularly high prevalence rates in South and Southeast Asia (India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam), sub-Saharan Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa), and parts of Latin America (Brazil, Mexico), where resistance rates in E. coli urinary isolates frequently exceed 30-40%; developed regions including North America, Europe, and Australia show lower but increasing resistance rates of 15-25%, with resistance genes often carried on mobile genetic elements such as integrons and plasmids that facilitate horizontal transfer and geographic spread through international travel, food trade, and healthcare systems.",True,109.31,"Now I have comprehensive data. Let me compile the answer based on all the information gathered:

Trimethoprim resistance is predominantly observed in members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, with Escherichia coli (3,701 resistant isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3,254), Salmonella enterica (2,013), and Shigella species (1,822 combined) representing the majority of phenotypically resistant strains, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5,140 isolates) from Streptococcaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii (832) from Moraxellaceae. The predominant resistance mechanism involves the TRIMETHOPRIM gene class encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) variants, with dhfrI and its allelic variants (dhfrI_1, dhfrI_2, dhfrI_3, dhfrI_4) accounting for the vast majority of resistance genes across E. coli, Shigella, and Salmonella species, alongside dfrA and dfrD variants in Klebsiella and other Enterobacteriaceae, and folA variants in Staphylococcus aureus. According to research retrieved from PubMed ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.23.634126)), dihydrofolate reductase serves as a key antibiotic target by catalyzing the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate in folate metabolism, and resistance arises through amino acid substitutions that reduce trimethoprim binding while maintaining enzymatic function for bacterial survival. Geographically, trimethoprim-resistant isolates show widespread global distribution with the highest concentrations in the Americas, particularly the United States (5,229 resistant isolates), followed by Asia with major contributions from Thailand (1,754), Pakistan (345), China (335), Bangladesh (310), Vietnam (307), and India (290), Africa led by South Africa (1,260), Malawi (324), and Kenya (244), Europe with Norway (1,026) and the United Kingdom (745), and Oceania represented by Australia (954), indicating that trimethoprim resistance is a global public health concern with particularly high prevalence in North America, Southeast Asia, and Southern Africa.","mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_endpoints, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata",4,4,3,4,15,,4,2,3,4,13,

  - ELECTRON MICROSCOPY","X-RAY DIFFRACTION accounts for the greatest number of distinct structural entries for reviewed human serine proteases, with 1,880 PDB entries, vastly outnumbering ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (137 entries) and SOLUTION NMR (37 entries). This distribution was determined by cross-referencing the 141 reviewed human serine protease sequences from UniProt Swiss-Prot (keyword KW-0720, Homo sapiens) against all PDB entries via the UniProt accession links in the structure database. The total of 2,055 unique PDB entries spans five experimental techniques; two minor methods — ELECTRON CRYSTALLOGRAPHY (1 entry) and NEUTRON DIFFRACTION (1 entry) — also appear. The 2,056 method-level annotations for 2,055 unique entries indicate that one entry was deposited under two experimental methods (valid overlap). The overwhelming dominance of X-ray crystallography (91.5% of entries) reflects the historical tractability of serine proteases for crystal formation: their well-defined active-site geometry, availability of high-affinity inhibitor co-crystals, and pharmaceutical relevance as drug targets have driven decades of intensive crystallographic campaigns. Electron microscopy is still underrepresented for this family because most clinically relevant serine proteases are monomeric enzymes with molecular weights below ~100 kDa, at the lower end of optimal cryo-EM resolution, whereas solution NMR captures only the smaller members of the family.
",True,6.09,"**X-RAY DIFFRACTION**

X-ray crystallography (X-RAY DIFFRACTION) accounts for the vast majority of three-dimensional structure entries for reviewed human serine proteases in the Protein Data Bank. This technique has been the predominant method for determining serine protease structures since the early days of protein crystallography, with landmark structures like thrombin, trypsin, and the coagulation cascade proteases being solved primarily through this approach. The technique is particularly well-suited for serine proteases because many of these enzymes can be readily crystallized, especially when bound to inhibitors or substrate analogs that stabilize their conformations. While SOLUTION NMR has contributed some serine protease structures, particularly for smaller domains or fragments, and ELECTRON MICROSCOPY has emerged more recently for larger complexes, the overwhelming number of atomic-resolution structures of human serine proteases deposited in structural databases have been determined by X-ray crystallography, making it by far the dominant technique for this protein family.",True,159.11,"Perfect!

- ELECTRON MICROSCOPY: 157 structures
- SOLUTION NMR: 77 structures
- Other methods: 3 structures (neutron diffraction, electron crystallography, solid-state NMR)

**X-RAY DIFFRACTION** clearly accounts for the greatest number of distinct three-dimensional structure entries for reviewed human serine proteases, with 2,338 structures compared to 157 for electron microscopy and 77 for solution NMR.

Human serine proteases are a diverse family of enzymes with crucial biological functions in blood coagulation, immune response, and tissue remodeling. Among the three major experimental techniques used to determine three-dimensional protein structures, X-ray diffraction dominates with 2,338 distinct structure entries for reviewed human serine proteases in the Protein Data Bank, representing over 90% of all structures for this protein family. This overwhelming preference for X-ray crystallography reflects its historical advantage in determining high-resolution structures of well-ordered proteins, particularly for medically important targets like thrombin, trypsin, and various coagulation factors that are amenable to crystallization. In comparison, electron microscopy accounts for only 157 structures while solution NMR contributes 77 structures, indicating that while these techniques have grown in capability and application, X-ray diffraction remains the predominant method for structural characterization of human serine proteases due to its proven success in producing high-quality atomic-resolution structures essential for drug discovery and mechanistic studies.","mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_endpoints, mcp__togomcp__togoid_getRelation, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__togoid_convertId, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",5,5,3,4,17,"The evaluated answer contains all necessary information from the ideal answer, including the number of distinct three-dimensional structure entries for reviewed human serine proteases and the dominance of X-RAY DIFFRACTION in this field.

In MedGen's MGREL database, this concept has 47 documented ""manifestation_of"" relationships, one of which links it to Cholecystitis (MedGen:C0008325). While metachromatic leukodystrophy is primarily known for progressive neurological manifestations — including peripheral demyelination, cerebellar ataxia, and intellectual disability — gallbladder involvement, including Cholecystitis and gallbladder dysfunction, is documented in the structured clinical data. This reflects the systemic nature of sulfatide accumulation in MLD: ARSA normally degrades sulfatides in lysosomes throughout the body, and excess sulfatide deposits in gallbladder epithelial cells and bile ducts can lead to cholecystitis and gallbladder polyps. This association is catalogued in MedGen's clinical knowledge graph but is not prominent in the standard biomedical literature, making it non-trivially verifiable without querying current structured databases.

question_038,choice,"Among the five Mus musculus limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs Capn3, Dysf, Lmna, Ano5, and Plec, which has the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts in Ensembl GRCm39?

Choose one of the following options:
  - Capn3
  - Dysf
  - Lmna
  - Ano5
  - Plec","Among the five Mus musculus limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs compared, Plec (encoding plectin, the mouse ortholog of the human LGMD2Q gene PLEC) has by far the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts in Ensembl GRCm39 with 21 isoforms, followed by Dysf (dysferlin, LGMD2B ortholog) with 12, Capn3 (calpain 3, LGMD2A ortholog) with 10, Lmna (lamin A, LGMD1B ortholog) with 4, and Ano5 (anoctamin 5, LGMD2L ortholog) with 3. Plec's exceptional transcript diversity reflects its unique genomic architecture: the mouse Plec gene encodes at least 11 alternative first exons (1a–1j and a common exon 2) that each splice into a shared downstream coding region, producing tissue-specific isoforms directed to distinct subcellular compartments — for example, isoform 1a targets hemidesmosomes in epithelia while isoform 1f localises to costameres and Z-discs in striated muscle. Dysf's 12 isoforms reflect alternative splicing of its tandem C2 domain array, relevant to its role in membrane repair at the sarcolemma. Capn3's 10 isoforms include the muscle-specific p94 form and lens isoform Lp82 arising from alternative promoter usage. By contrast, Lmna (4 isoforms, primarily lamin A and lamin C from alternative splicing at exon 10) and Ano5 (3 isoforms) are architecturally simpler. The striking isoform count difference between Plec and Ano5 (21 vs. 3) therefore does not reflect clinical severity but rather the mechanistic complexity of their membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding roles versus channel/lipid scramblase functions.
",True,6.58,"The correct answer is **Lmna**.

Lmna (Lamin A/C) has the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts among these five limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs in Ensembl GRCm39. The Lmna gene exhibits extensive alternative splicing, producing multiple protein-coding transcript variants that encode different isoforms of nuclear lamins, including lamin A and lamin C as the major products, along with several minor isoforms. This complex transcriptional architecture reflects the diverse structural and regulatory roles of lamins in nuclear organization, chromatin structure, and gene expression. In contrast, while genes like Dysf (dysferlin) and Plec (plectin) are also large genes that can produce multiple transcripts, and Capn3 (calpain-3) and Ano5 (anoctamin-5) generate fewer variants, none match the transcript diversity of Lmna in the mouse genome assembly GRCm39.",True,181.54,"Perfect!

- **Plec**: **22 protein-coding transcripts**

The correct answer is **Plec**.

**Plec** has the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts in Ensembl GRCm39 with 22 transcripts, significantly more than the other limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs. Plectin is a large scaffolding protein that cross-links cytoskeletal elements and is known to have extensive alternative splicing with multiple tissue-specific isoforms generated from alternative first exons, which explains its high transcript count. Dysf has the second-highest with 13 protein-coding transcripts, followed by Capn3 (11), Lmna (4), and Ano5 (3).","mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esummary, mcp__togomcp__togoid_convertId, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_efetch, Bash, Bash, Bash, Bash, Bash, Bash, Bash, Bash",2,4,3,4,13,,5,5,5,5,20,"The evaluated answer correctly identifies Plec as having the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts in Ensembl GRCm39, with a total of 22 transcripts.

SCN5A encodes the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 and is the primary causal gene for Brugada syndrome, responsible for 15–30% of cases through loss-of-function variants; its ChEMBL entry reflects its central role as a drug target for antiarrhythmic compounds and as a cardiac safety liability. The potassium channels KCNH2 (hERG) and KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) are prominent ChEMBL targets because inhibition of hERG is a major mechanism of drug-induced QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. CACNA1C encodes the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2, a target for dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. RYR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) is targeted by flecainide and other agents used in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, a related channelopathy with substantial overlap in the research literature. The complete overlap between the high-frequency co-annotation set and ChEMBL pharmacological targets reflects the ion-channel-centric pathophysiology of Brugada syndrome and the translational significance of these genes in cardiac drug development and safety pharmacology.

Nine of the 10 reactions are catalyzed by MenA-type 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate octaprenyltransferases: one generic reaction covers all-trans-polyprenyl chain lengths (RHEA:26478), and eight chain-length-specific reactions cover hexaprenyl (MK-6), heptaprenyl (MK-7), octaprenyl (MK-8), nonaprenyl (MK-9), decaprenyl (MK-10), undecaprenyl (MK-11), dodecaprenyl (MK-12), and tridecaprenyl (MK-13) diphosphates as cosubstrates, each producing the corresponding demethylmenaquinol and releasing CO2 and diphosphate. The tenth reaction (RHEA:26309) is the upstream MenH thioesterase step that produces DHNA by hydrolysis of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl-CoA. This enzymatic diversity reflects the organism-specific variation in menaquinone side-chain length across bacteria.

Of the eleven human siglec-family glycoproteins represented in GlyCosmos (SIGLEC5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16), these four are the only members for which site-resolved glycoproteomic mass spectrometry data have been curated: SIGLEC5 has 34 annotated glycosylation sites with 33 associated glycan structures (GlyConnect entry 568), SIGLEC7 has 32 sites with 31 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 569), SIGLEC8 has 28 sites with 27 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 570), and SIGLEC14 has 14 sites with 9 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 1978). The remaining seven siglecs (SIGLEC6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16) are recorded in GlyCosmos with glycosylation site predictions from GlyGen but lack curated per-site glycan composition data. Three of the four characterized siglecs (SIGLEC5, 7, 8) are CD33-related inhibitory receptors carrying cytoplasmic ITIMs, while SIGLEC14 is an activating receptor paired with DAP12; all four are expressed primarily on myeloid or NK cells and play roles in immune tolerance, allergy regulation, and innate immune modulation. Dense N-glycosylation of siglec ectodomains is biologically significant because the glycan shield can occlude the V-set sialic acid-binding domain, favoring cis-ligand masking on the cell surface over trans-ligand engagement, and modulating receptor clustering and signaling thresholds.
",True,9.02,"Based on glycoproteomic database curation efforts, several human siglec proteins have experimentally characterized N-glycan structures at specific glycosylation sites. Siglec-1 (CD169/sialoadhesin) has detailed N-glycan characterization at multiple sites, including complex and high-mannose type structures identified through mass spectrometry-based glycoproteomics. Siglec-2 (CD22) contains well-characterized N-glycosylation sites with documented glycan compositions and structures, particularly relevant given its role in B-cell regulation. Siglec-3 (CD33) has experimentally validated N-glycan structures at several consensus sequons, with glycoproteomic data catalogued from various cell types and expression systems.

Now let me compile the final comprehensive list of which siglecs have N-glycosylation data with site-specific information in GlyCosmos:

Based on my queries, I have found the following information:

**From GlyCosmos (with glycosylation data):**

11. Siglec-15 (Q6ZMC9) - 1 site, no glycan structures
12. Siglec-16 (A6NMB1) - 6 sites, 2 with glycan structures, no position data

question_045,summary,"What are the structural characteristics of 3-demethylubiquinones as intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis, and how are they enzymatically converted to ubiquinones?","3-Demethylubiquinones are penultimate intermediates in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway that differ from their mature ubiquinone counterparts by a single structural feature: a free hydroxyl group (-OH) at ring position 3 instead of the methoxyl group (-OCH3) found in ubiquinones, classifying them ontologically as monohydroxy-1,4-benzoquinones within the broader ubiquinone family. This single substituent difference translates to a molecular mass difference of approximately 14 Da for each chain-length variant; for example, 3-demethylubiquinone-9 has the molecular formula C53H80O4 with a molecular weight of 781.2 Da (compared to 795.2 Da for ubiquinone-9), while 3-demethylubiquinone-10 has the formula C58H88O4 with a molecular weight of 849.3 Da (compared to 863.3 Da for coenzyme Q10). Their conversion to ubiquinones is catalyzed by SAM-dependent O-methyltransferases in a reaction where S-adenosyl-L-methionine donates a methyl group to the hydroxyl at position 3, yielding the corresponding ubiquinol (reduced) or ubiquinone (oxidized) product along with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. The Rhea database catalogues 7 approved reactions of this type, comprising 2 generic reactions covering the entire class of 3-demethylubiquinone and 3-demethylubiquinol species and 5 chain-length-specific reactions for the n=6, n=7, n=8, n=9, and n=10 polyprenyl variants that predominate across different organisms.
",True,9.72,"3-Demethylubiquinones are quinone intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis characterized by a benzoquinone ring bearing a methoxy group at position 2, a hydroxyl group at position 3, and an isoprenoid side chain of varying length (typically 6-10 isoprene units) at position 5, lacking the methyl group at position 3 that is present in mature ubiquinones. These compounds possess a polyprenyl tail that is already fully assembled but remain incompletely modified on the aromatic head group. The enzymatic conversion to ubiquinones is catalyzed by the methyltransferase enzyme Coq3 (also known as UbiG in bacteria), which specifically transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to the hydroxyl group at position 3 of the benzoquinone ring. This methylation reaction converts the 3-hydroxyl group to a 3-methoxy group, generating the characteristic trimethoxy substitution pattern of mature ubiquinones (methoxy groups at positions 2, 3, and 6). Coq3/UbiG belongs to the SAM-dependent O-methyltransferase family and recognizes the specific structure of 3-demethylubiquinone through both the quinone head group and the hydrophobic polyprenyl tail. The methylation step typically occurs late in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway, after most other ring modifications including hydroxylation and prior methylations at other positions have been completed, and is essential for generating the fully functional electron carrier that participates in mitochondrial respiratory chain activity.",True,98.14,"Based on the information retrieved from biochemical databases and PubMed, 3-demethylubiquinones are late-stage intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis characterized by a benzoquinone ring structure with a methoxy group at the 2-position, a long polyisoprenoid side chain (varying from 6 to 10 isoprenoid units depending on the organism), and critically, lacking a methyl group at the 3-position that is present in the final ubiquinone product. The pathway producing these intermediates begins with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid as the ring precursor, which undergoes prenylation and a series of modifications including hydroxylation at carbon-6 by monooxygenases such as COQ7 (or UbiF in bacteria) to form 2-methoxy-5-methyl-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone, followed by an additional hydroxylation step that removes the methyl group from position 5, yielding the 3-demethylubiquinone intermediate ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.272.14.9182), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo11060385)). The enzymatic conversion of 3-demethylubiquinone to ubiquinone is catalyzed by the C-methyltransferase enzyme COQ5 (or UbiE in bacteria), which uses S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor to methylate the hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the benzoquinone ring, producing the final ubiquinone molecule with release of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine as demonstrated in Rhea reaction RHEA:81215 and characterized in yeast and bacterial systems ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M313712200), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1093/plcell/koad202)).

question_046,yes_no,"Does AXIN1, the scaffold protein that nucleates the beta-catenin destruction complex in canonical Wnt signaling, have a phosphorylated form with specifically annotated concurrent phosphorylation at threonine and serine residues documented in any curated human Wnt pathway entry?","AXIN1 (UniProt O15169, AXIN1_HUMAN), a manually reviewed human protein, does indeed have a phosphorylated form with specifically annotated concurrent threonine and serine modifications curated in the Reactome human pathway database. The phosphorylated isoform designated p-T481,S486,S493-AXIN1 carries three co-occurring modifications: O-phospho-L-threonine at position 481 and O-phospho-L-serine at positions 486 and 493. These phosphorylation events are documented within the curated biochemical reaction ""AXIN is phosphorylated in the destruction complex"" (R-HSA-5229343), which is a component of the human pathway ""Degradation of beta-catenin by the destruction complex"" (R-HSA-195253), itself nested within the broader ""Signaling by WNT"" hierarchy (R-HSA-195721). Mechanistically, the destruction complex—assembled by AXIN1 as scaffold, together with APC, CK1, and GSK3-beta—sequentially phosphorylates beta-catenin to mark it for proteasomal degradation; the phosphorylation of AXIN1 itself at T481, S486, and S493 enhances its stability within the complex and potentiates beta-catenin turnover, thereby maintaining the off-state of canonical Wnt signaling in the absence of Wnt ligand.
",True,9.57,"AXIN1, which serves as the central scaffold protein organizing the β-catenin destruction complex in canonical Wnt signaling, undergoes extensive phosphorylation at multiple serine and threonine residues. The protein contains numerous documented phosphorylation sites, with mass spectrometry studies identifying phosphorylation at serine residues (including S322, S330, S333) and threonine residues (including T485, T523) among many others. Curated pathway databases such as Reactome, KEGG, and WikiPathways document AXIN1 phosphorylation in their Wnt signaling pathway entries, though the specific concurrent phosphorylation of both threonine and serine residues simultaneously on the same AXIN1 molecule is typically represented as general phosphorylation states rather than with site-specific combinatorial annotations. The phosphorylation of AXIN1 is functionally important, as it regulates the protein's stability, interaction with other destruction complex components including APC and GSK3β, and its role in facilitating β-catenin phosphorylation. While individual phosphorylation sites have been biochemically characterized and their functional consequences studied, curated pathway databases generally represent AXIN1 phosphorylation status in a simplified manner, indicating the phosphorylated state without necessarily specifying all concurrent modifications at individual serine and threonine residues within a single pathway annotation.",True,134.02,"Based on my comprehensive analysis of the Reactome database, I now have sufficient information to answer the question definitively.

This triply phosphorylated form participates in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway within the beta-catenin destruction complex, appearing in the biochemical reaction ""AXIN is phosphorylated in the destruction complex"" that converts the unphosphorylated AXIN-containing destruction complex to its phosphorylated form.

question_050,choice,"Among Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which species has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records?

Choose one of the following options:
  - Klebsiella pneumoniae
  - Acinetobacter baumannii
  - Salmonella enterica
  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Salmonella enterica has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records, with 23 distinct classes, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16), and Acinetobacter baumannii (14). The 28 total unique classes across all four species (sum of per-species counts = 75; 75 > 28, indicating 47 class-instances are shared, with core classes such as BETA-LACTAM, AMINOGLYCOSIDE, QUINOLONE, TETRACYCLINE, and SULFONAMIDE present in all four species) reflects extensive horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants among Gram-negative pathogens. Salmonella enterica's broader drug-class repertoire is consistent with its diverse ecological niches spanning human clinical, livestock, and environmental reservoirs, which expose bacterial populations to a wide range of selective antibiotic pressures and facilitate acquisition of resistance genes from taxonomically distant organisms; distinctive Salmonella classes include BLEOMYCIN, STREPTOTHRICIN, RIFAMYCIN, FOSFOMYCIN, and GLYCOPEPTIDE. Notably, this class-breadth ranking diverges from gene-symbol diversity: K. pneumoniae has substantially more distinct gene symbols in AMRPortal but a narrower class range than Salmonella by just one class, reflecting K. pneumoniae's depth in a few resistance mechanisms (especially BETA-LACTAM diversity via ESBLs and carbapenemases) rather than breadth across classes. Acinetobacter baumannii, despite its clinical reputation as extensively drug-resistant, shows the fewest distinct drug classes (14) among the four ESKAPE pathogens in current surveillance records, as its resistance phenotype is largely driven by a concentrated set of OXA-type carbapenemases and efflux pump mechanisms rather than broad class diversification.
",True,8.77,"**Klebsiella pneumoniae** is the correct answer.

Klebsiella pneumoniae demonstrates resistance to the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes among these four species in genotypic surveillance records. This bacterium carries resistance genes spanning beta-lactams (including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams via various beta-lactamases like ESBLs, KPC, NDM, OXA-48), aminoglycosides (through modifying enzymes and 16S rRNA methylases), fluoroquinolones (via mutations in gyrA/parC and qnr genes), tetracyclines, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, fosfomycin, colistin (mcr genes), and even newer agents like tigecycline and ceftazidime-avibactam. While Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are extensively drug-resistant pathogens with resistance to many classes, K. pneumoniae's combination of intrinsic resistance mechanisms, exceptional capacity to acquire mobile genetic elements (plasmids carrying multiple resistance determinants), and its role as a reservoir for resistance genes in healthcare settings results in the broadest representation of resistance gene classes in surveillance databases. The extensive documentation of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae strains worldwide, coupled with co-resistance to virtually all antibiotic classes except occasional susceptibility to colistin and tigecycline, exemplifies this species' unparalleled genetic diversity in antimicrobial resistance.",True,49.32,"Perfect! The data confirms Klebsiella pneumoniae has 22 distinct AMR classes. The results are clear and comprehensive.

**Salmonella enterica** is the correct answer.

Salmonella enterica has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records with 24 different AMR classes, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22 classes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 classes), and Acinetobacter baumannii (14 classes). The AMR Portal database contains genotypic resistance features across 1.1 million surveillance records, with Salmonella enterica showing resistance genes spanning the broadest spectrum of drug classes including efflux systems, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, beta-lactams, phenicols, fosfomycin, quinolones, trimethoprim, macrolides, colistin, rifamycins, bleomycin, lincosamides, streptogramins, streptothricins, glycopeptides, and several multidrug resistance categories.","mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",5,5,5,5,20,"The evaluated answer accurately recalls all necessary information from the ideal answer, presents relevant information without unnecessary tangents, avoids repetition, and is well-structured and fluent.",5,5,5,5,20,"The evaluated answer accurately contains all necessary information from the ideal answer, presents relevant information without unnecessary content, avoids repetition, and is well-structured and fluent."
