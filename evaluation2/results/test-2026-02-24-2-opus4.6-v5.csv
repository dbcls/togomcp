question_001,yes_no,Does the HSPB1 gene have pathogenic variants documented in ClinVar for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease?,"Yes, HSPB1 (heat shock protein family B (small) member 1, Gene ID 3315) has multiple pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants documented in ClinVar that are specifically linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F (CMT2F; MedGen C1847823), the HSPB1-associated axonal subtype of CMT. The exact count depends on the database snapshot; the RDF portal query returned 20 current records at time of query, while the live NCBI ClinVar release contains ≥66 such variants. Variants include missense substitutions affecting functionally critical residues in the alpha-crystallin domain (e.g., c.379C>T p.Arg127Trp, c.404C>T p.Ser135Phe, c.406C>T p.Arg136Trp, c.418C>G p.Arg140Gly, c.545C>T p.Pro182Leu), as well as frameshift and nonsense variants (e.g., c.109dup p.Arg37fs (Likely pathogenic), c.532G>T p.Glu178Ter (Likely pathogenic)). Several large deletions at the HSPB1 locus on chromosome 7q11.23 also appear in the dataset. CMT2F is an autosomal dominant axonal peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy characterised by distal muscle weakness, sensory loss, and reduced tendon reflexes with onset ranging from the first to sixth decade.
",True,7.6,"Yes, the HSPB1 gene has pathogenic variants documented in ClinVar for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. HSPB1 (Heat Shock Protein Family B Member 1), which encodes the small heat shock protein HSP27, is associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F (CMT2F) and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type IIB (dHMN-IIB), both inherited peripheral neuropathies. Multiple missense variants in HSPB1 have been classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in ClinVar for these conditions, typically following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. These disease-causing variants commonly affect the alpha-crystallin domain of the protein, which is critical for its chaperone function and proper protein folding. The mutations disrupt the protein's ability to form functional oligomers and impair its protective role in maintaining neuronal integrity, particularly in long peripheral axons. Notable pathogenic variants include S135F, R136W, P182L, and several others that have been reported in multiple families with CMT2F or dHMN presentations. The presence of these documented pathogenic variants in ClinVar reflects the established role of HSPB1 as a causative gene for inherited peripheral neuropathies within the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease spectrum.",True,54.56,"Yes, the HSPB1 gene has pathogenic variants documented in ClinVar for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. ClinVar contains 70 variants in HSPB1 classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic that are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, specifically the axonal type 2F subtype (CMT2F). These pathogenic variants are predominantly missense mutations affecting critical amino acid positions in the HSPB1 protein, including well-characterized variants such as p.Ser135Phe (c.404C>T), p.Arg127Trp (c.379C>T), p.Thr151Ile (c.452C>T), p.Pro182Leu (c.545C>T), p.Arg136Trp (c.406C>T), p.Pro182Ser (c.544C>T), and p.Arg140Gly (c.418C>G).

question_004,summary,Summarize the distribution of melatonin biosynthesis enzymes across species and characterize their molecular functions and the chemical intermediates involved.,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are distributed across 16 species spanning three kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi), with 33 reviewed proteins in total. Mammals account for 14 proteins across 9 taxa, including two human paralogs (AANAT and ASMT), with coverage extending to mouse, rat, cattle, sheep, macaque, hamster, chimpanzee, and Mus musculus molossinus. Plants contribute 14 proteins from 4 taxa: Arabidopsis thaliana (4 proteins), Oryza sativa subsp. japonica (7 proteins, the most of any single organism), Oryza sativa subsp. indica (1 protein), and Zea mays (2 proteins). Additional representatives include two bird proteins in Gallus gallus, two insect proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, and one fungal protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The pathway proceeds through two enzymatic steps acting on distinct chemical intermediates: first, aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT, GO:0004059, a subclass of N-acetyltransferase activity) converts serotonin (CHEBI:28790, C10H12N2O) to N-acetylserotonin (CHEBI:17697, C12H14N2O2); then acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT, GO:0017096, a subclass of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity) converts N-acetylserotonin to melatonin (CHEBI:16796, C13H16N2O2). Exactly 17 proteins are annotated with AANAT activity and 16 with ASMT activity, with no overlap. This enzymatic conservation across evolutionarily distant taxa — from yeast to plants to mammals — indicates an ancient origin of the two-step melatonin biosynthesis mechanism, with the pathway starting from tryptophan (CHEBI:27897, C11H12N2O2) via serotonin as the upstream precursor.
",True,9.54,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes exhibit broad phylogenetic distribution, occurring in bacteria, protists, fungi, plants, and animals, though the complete canonical pathway is most consistently present in vertebrates. The biosynthetic pathway begins with the essential amino acid tryptophan, which undergoes hydroxylation by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) to form 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) then converts 5-HTP to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). The rate-limiting enzyme arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) acetylates serotonin using acetyl-CoA as a cofactor to produce N-acetylserotonin (NAS). Finally, acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT), also known as hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), methylates NAS using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor to generate melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptophan). In vertebrates, particularly mammals, this pathway is predominantly localized to the pineal gland, with AANAT serving as the regulatory enzyme controlling circadian melatonin rhythms. Plants possess alternative pathways and utilize different enzyme variants, including tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) and serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT), with caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) potentially substituting for ASMT in some species. In non-vertebrate animals and microorganisms, the enzymatic machinery is less characterized, and alternative biosynthetic routes may exist, with some organisms synthesizing melatonin through pathways that bypass serotonin as an intermediate or utilize different methylation and acetylation steps.",True,108.39,"Now I have all the data needed to provide a comprehensive answer. Let me compile the information:

Based on comprehensive database queries, I have gathered information about:
1. Two main enzymes (SNAT/AANAT EC 2.3.1.87 and ASMT/HIOMT EC 2.1.1.4)
2. Species distribution across animals (18 reviewed proteins), plants (12), and fungi (1)
3. Key reactions and intermediates from Rhea and Reactome
4. Molecular functions from GO annotations

Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes exhibit broad phylogenetic distribution across animals, plants, and fungi, with two principal enzymes catalyzing sequential reactions in the canonical pathway. Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT, also termed arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase or AANAT, EC 2.3.1.87) represents the first committed step, exhibiting aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase activity (GO:0004059) and broader acyltransferase activity (GO:0016746), converting serotonin to N-acetylserotonin using acetyl-CoA as the acetyl donor. The second enzyme, acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT, also termed hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase or HIOMT, EC 2.1.1.4), displays methyltransferase activity (GO:0008168) and catalyzes the conversion of N-acetylserotonin to melatonin using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor, with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and a proton as byproducts. Among 31 reviewed proteins in UniProt, distribution is predominantly metazoan (18 proteins spanning mammals including humans, mice, rats, cattle, sheep, and primates; birds including chicken; and invertebrates including fruit fly), with significant representation in plants (12 proteins in Arabidopsis and rice, often localized to chloroplasts), and minimal fungal presence (1 protein in yeast). The biosynthetic pathway proceeds through key intermediates: tryptophan is hydroxylated to 5-hydroxytryptophan (EC 1.14.16.4), which undergoes decarboxylation to serotonin (EC 4.1.1.28), followed by N-acetylation to N-acetylserotonin (EC 2.3.1.87) and final O-methylation to melatonin (EC 2.1.1.4 or 2.1.1). Alternative routes exist, including direct acetylation of 5-methoxytryptamine by acetyl-CoA, and catabolic pathways involving hydroxylation of melatonin by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases to form 2-hydroxymelatonin with succinate and carbon dioxide as coproducts. Reactome pathway annotations document these reactions across multiple vertebrate species and selected invertebrates and fungi, establishing melatonin biosynthesis as an evolutionarily conserved process with both circadian regulatory functions in animals and pleiotropic roles in plant stress responses.","mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_endpoints, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",3,4,5,5,17,"Has pathway enzymes and intermediates including TPH, AADC, AANAT, ASMT, and plant alternatives.

question_005,choice,"Among the following kinase groups — AGC, CAMK, CMGC, and TK — which has the greatest number of human protein targets with experimentally determined X-ray crystal structures deposited in the PDB?

Choose one of the following options:
  - AGC
  - CAMK
  - CMGC
  - TK","TK (tyrosine kinases) has the greatest number of human protein targets with
PDB X-ray crystal structures, with 2,280 structures across 80 ChEMBL-classified
human targets. CMGC ranks second (1,539 structures, 58 targets), followed by
CAMK (734 structures, 65 targets) and AGC (422 structures, 59 targets).

TK dominates structural coverage because tyrosine kinases are the primary targets
in cancer drug discovery. The EGFR family alone (EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4) accounts
for hundreds of entries; BCR-ABL1 (P00519) has over 200 structures due to
imatinib-resistance studies; VEGFR2/KDR (P35968), ALK (Q9UM73), c-MET (P08581),
RET (P07949), FGFR1-4, and the SRC family kinases each contribute dozens to
hundreds of structures. The pharmaceutical industry's intense focus on TK
inhibitors for oncology has driven an outsized crystallographic effort relative
to the number of targets.

CMGC ranks second because it includes intensively studied targets: CDK2 (P24941)
alone has over 400 PDB structures from fragment-based and structure-based drug
design campaigns; CDK4/6 (cyclin-dependent kinases), CDK8, CDK9, MAPK1/ERK2
(P28482), MAPK14/p38α (Q16539), GSK3B (P49841), and DYRK1A (Q13627) are all
major drug targets with large structural datasets.

CAMK ranks third despite having the most targets (65) among the four groups,
because many CAMK members (e.g., CaM kinases, DAPK, CHK1, CHK2) are less
pharmacologically tractable or have been structurally solved fewer times.

AGC ranks last (422 structures) despite its prominent members (AKT1/2/3, PKCα,
PKA, RSK1-4, S6K1) because several AGC kinases proved challenging for structural
biology due to flexibility or membrane association, and the group has fewer
members overall.

A note on cross-group overlap: 70 PDB structures (1.4%) contain proteins with
dual classification in ChEMBL (6 proteins annotated as both AGC and CAMK). These
structures are counted in both groups' totals. This overlap does not affect the
answer — TK leads CMGC by 741 structures, far exceeding the 70-structure overlap.
",True,7.76,"**TK**

The tyrosine kinase (TK) group has the greatest number of human protein targets with experimentally determined X-ray crystal structures deposited in the PDB among these four kinase groups. This is primarily due to the enormous biomedical and pharmaceutical interest in tyrosine kinases, which play critical roles in cell signaling, growth, and proliferation, and are major targets for cancer therapeutics. The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as cancer drugs has driven extensive structural biology efforts to determine crystal structures of these kinases in complex with various inhibitors and in different conformational states. Notable examples include EGFR, ABL, SRC, and many receptor tyrosine kinases, which have been crystallized numerous times in different states and with different ligands. While the AGC, CAMK, and CMGC groups also contain therapeutically important kinases with solved structures, the sheer clinical relevance of tyrosine kinases in oncology has resulted in a disproportionately large number of PDB entries for TK group members compared to the other serine/threonine kinase groups.",True,102.06,"**TK**

These organisms exhibit varying oxygen tolerance characteristics: obligate anaerobes are killed by atmospheric oxygen exposure and lack superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes (e.g., Clostridium, Bacteroides fragilis group); aerotolerant anaerobes can survive oxygen presence but do not use it metabolically (e.g., some Propionibacterium species); and facultative anaerobes can switch between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism (e.g., Escherichia coli, though primarily considered a facultative organism). Typical culture conditions require oxygen-free environments achieved through anaerobic chambers, jars with gas-generating sachets, or roll-tube techniques, with atmospheres containing nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide (commonly 80-90% N₂, 5-10% H₂, 5-10% CO₂).

question_009,list,Which human enzymes with catalytic roles in the leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway are documented drug targets in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records?,"Five of the eight human enzymes with catalytic roles in the Reactome leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway have mechanism-of-action records in ChEMBL. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, CHEMBL215) has the most ChEMBL mechanism records of any pathway enzyme, with eight drugs documented as inhibitors, including zileuton (phase 4), the only FDA-approved drug specifically indicated for asthma that acts by reversibly inhibiting this rate-limiting step in leukotriene synthesis, as well as five other phase-4 anti-inflammatory agents (mesalamine, sulfasalazine, balsalazide disodium, olsalazine sodium, meclofenamate sodium) and two phase-2 clinical candidates (PF-4191834, atreleuton). The 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP/FLAP, CHEMBL4550) is the most clinically active target, with three distinct phase-3 clinical inhibitors — fiboflapon, fiboflapon sodium, and veliflapon — all documented as INHIBITOR mechanisms. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H, CHEMBL4618), which converts LTA4 to the potent chemoattractant LTB4, is targeted by acebilustat at phase 2. The multidrug resistance-associated protein ABCC1/MRP1 (CHEMBL3004), which exports LTC4 across the cell membrane as part of the pathway, is targeted by the phase-2 multidrug resistance modulator biricodar. MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2, CHEMBL2208), which activates ALOX5 via phosphorylation, is targeted at phase 1 by AT-13148, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor. Three pathway enzymes — arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1), and leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) — lack ChEMBL mechanism records despite participating in the pathway, reflecting their lower prioritisation as drug targets in clinical development programmes.
",True,10.47,"The human enzymes with catalytic roles in leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis that are documented as drug targets in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records include 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), which catalyzes the initial oxidation of arachidonic acid to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) and its subsequent conversion to leukotriene A4, and is targeted by inhibitors such as zileuton used in asthma treatment. Leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) conjugates glutathione to leukotriene A4 to form leukotriene C4, the precursor of cysteinyl leukotrienes, though it has fewer registered inhibitors in clinical use. Additionally, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP/ALOX5AP), while not directly catalytic, is essential for presenting arachidonic acid to 5-lipoxygenase and is targeted by compounds like MK-591 and other FLAP inhibitors documented in ChEMBL. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) converts leukotriene A4 to the pro-inflammatory leukotriene B4 and represents another documented drug target with various inhibitors in development. The cysteinyl leukotriene receptors CysLT1 and CysLT2, though not enzymatic, are prominent drug targets for receptor antagonists like montelukast and zafirlukast. For the eoxin pathway, which utilizes 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15) to produce eoxins from arachidonic acid, this enzyme is also documented in ChEMBL as a drug target, though therapeutic agents specifically targeting eoxin biosynthesis remain less developed compared to leukotriene-directed therapies.",True,252.15,"Now let me verify which of these are specifically in the leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway (ALOX12 is mainly in the 12-HETE pathway, not the primary leukotriene/eoxin pathway).

Based on my comprehensive search and SPARQL queries, I have found that among the human enzymes with catalytic roles in leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathways, only **two** are documented as drug targets in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records: arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, also known as polyunsaturated fatty acid 5-lipoxygenase) and leukotriene A-4 hydrolase (LTA4H). ALOX5, encoded by the gene ALOX5 with UniProt accession P09917 and ChEMBL identifier CHEMBL215, catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene A4 (LTA4), the first committed step in both leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis, and has eight documented drug mechanisms with an inhibitor mechanism of action. LTA4H, encoded by the gene LTA4H with UniProt accession P09960 and ChEMBL identifier CHEMBL4618, catalyzes the hydrolysis of LTA4 to leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in the leukotriene biosynthesis pathway and has one documented drug mechanism with an inhibitor mechanism of action. Other key enzymes in these pathways, including leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), and arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase type B (ALOX15B), are present in ChEMBL as human protein targets but currently lack documented mechanism-of-action records in the database.","mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_endpoints, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_target, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_target, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_target, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_target, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_target, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",3,3,5,4,15,"Mentions ALOX5, ALOX5AP, LTA4H correctly but incorrectly includes LTC4S as having mechanism records and non-enzymatic CysLT receptors.

This substantially exceeds connective tissue disorder (134 TopicalDescriptors), autoimmune disease (61 TopicalDescriptors), and rheumatic disorder (39 TopicalDescriptors). The counts reflect confirmed joins with the MeSH RDF graph restricted to meshv:TopicalDescriptor entries (i.e., canonical MeSH headings used for indexing); MONDO cross-references to MeSH supplementary concept records (MESH:C...) are excluded. The four categories are not mutually exclusive: immune system disorder is the broadest and contains the other three as subcategories, so their diseases are counted within it as well — the sum across categories (482) exceeds the 346 unique diseases with TopicalDescriptor mappings due to this intentional overlap in the ontology hierarchy. The higher absolute count for immune system disorder reflects its greater scope rather than a higher per-disease mapping rate, since autoimmune disease and rheumatic disorder actually have proportionally good coverage relative to their size.

These ChEBI classes serve as type annotations for PubChem compound entries (via rdf:type assertions), enabling cross-database integration. Filtering for PubChem compounds (those with URIs starting with ""http://rdf.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/compound/"") that are typed by any of these 64 ChEBI classes yields 24 distinct compounds. These include central pathway intermediates such as protoporphyrinogen IX, Mg-protoporphyrin IX, and various chlorophyllide derivatives, as well as cofactors like NADPH, ATP, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine.

The database records 286 total glycosylation site entries for decorin, reflecting the multiple glycan structures (glycoforms) annotated at individual positions — position 211 alone carries 132 distinct glycoform entries and position 262 carries 121, indicating extensive N-glycan microheterogeneity at these asparagine residues. The site at position 34 corresponds to the canonical glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin/dermatan sulfate) attachment serine characteristic of the proteoglycan core protein.

question_015,summary,"Characterize the reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 across three dimensions: their GO-annotated functional module assignments (capsid, baseplate, and tail components); any enzymatic activities encoded among these otherwise structural late proteins; and their experimental structural coverage, including the relative proportions of cryo-electron microscopy versus X-ray crystallography depositions.","The 25 reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4, all annotated with KW-0426, collectively encode the phage's iconic contractile tail-injection nanomachine and partition into four major GO-defined structural modules: the capsid (2 proteins: CAPSH/major capsid protein, CAPSP/capsid vertex), the baseplate (11 proteins: the ten wedge and hub assembly proteins gp7, gp10, gp25, gp27, gp48, gp53, gp54, gp26, gp28, gp51, plus the pre-baseplate central spike gp5), the tail tube and completion system (4 proteins: gp19 tube, tail tube terminator, tape-measure protein, gp15 tail completion protein), and the tail fibers (5 proteins: short fiber gp12, three long-fiber subunits gp35/gp36/gp37, and the long-fiber proximal subunit), with the structural collar protein fibritin (WAC) and two DNA helicase isoforms (uvsW and uvsW1) completing the set. Enzymatically, two late proteins break the ""purely structural"" expectation: gp5 (NEEDL_BPT4) bears lysozyme activity (GO:0003796) that hydrolyzes peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall to puncture the host envelope during injection, while the uvsW DNA helicases (GO:0043138, 3'-5' DNA helicase activity) drive late-phase recombination and repair, a function unusual for proteins expressed after DNA replication has begun. Of the 25 proteins, 17 (68%) are structurally characterized in PDB via at least one entry, yielding 149 distinct structures (103 by cryo-electron microscopy, 44 by X-ray crystallography, 2 by solution NMR); because T4 assemblies are large multi-subunit complexes—the baseplate alone contains 11 late proteins—the same PDB entry frequently references multiple T4 proteins, producing 182 total protein-to-entry attributions for 149 distinct structures (33 attribution counts arise from co-occurrence in assemblies). The striking dominance of cryo-EM (69% of entries) reflects the field's shift toward studying intact viral assemblies: fibritin alone accounts for 104 of these entries due to its adoption as an engineering scaffold, while the gp5 spike (18 entries) and major capsid protein (9 entries) follow; the eight structurally uncharacterized proteins—most notably the three baseplate hub proteins gp26, gp28, and gp51, the two long tail-fiber subunits gp35 and gp36, and the two uvsW helicase isoforms—represent current frontiers in T4 structural biology.
",True,12.16,"The late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 comprise approximately 20-25 reviewed structural proteins that assemble into three primary functional modules based on GO annotations: the icosahedral capsid (including major capsid protein gp23, vertex protein gp24, and portal protein gp20), the baseplate assembly (consisting of gp5, gp6, gp7, gp8, gp9, gp10, gp11, gp25, gp26, gp27, gp48, and gp53), and the contractile tail apparatus (featuring tail sheath protein gp18, tail tube protein gp19, and tail terminator proteins gp3 and gp15). While predominantly structural, several late proteins possess notable enzymatic activities embedded within their architecture: gp5 contains a lysozyme domain that degrades peptidoglycan during infection, gp27 exhibits ATPase activity coordinating baseplate assembly, and gp16 and gp17 function as the terminase complex with ATP-dependent DNA packaging activity. The structural coverage of these proteins in the Protein Data Bank reflects a distinct methodological partition: X-ray crystallography dominates individual baseplate protein structures (gp5, gp27, gp10, gp11, gp8) and the terminase subunits, providing atomic resolution of domains and enzymatic sites, while cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions have comprehensively captured the assembled capsid, complete baseplate, and extended/contracted tail states at near-atomic resolution (3-4 Å), enabling visualization of protein-protein interfaces and conformational changes during infection.

This order, which includes well-studied nitrogen-fixing alpha-proteobacteria such as Rhizobium phaseoli (6 genes), Rhodopseudomonas palustris (4 genes), and Xanthobacter autotrophicus (4 genes), is the predominant source of characterized nitrogenase genes in current genomic databases, reflecting decades of genome sequencing focused on agriculturally important symbiotic and free-living diazotrophs. Eubacteriales (formerly Clostridiales) ranks second with 19 nifH/nifD genes from 8 organisms, including Clostridium pasteurianum DSM 525 (7 genes) as the dominant contributor, alongside other anaerobic nitrogen fixers such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum (3 genes) and Clostridium beijerinckii (2 genes). Burkholderiales has 11 genes from 5 organisms including the endophyte Herbaspirillum seropedicae, while Pseudomonadales has only 7 genes from 2 organisms, notably Azotobacter chroococcum. The dominance of Hyphomicrobiales (66 genes, 64% of the 103 genes in these four orders) reflects the extensive genome sequencing of alpha-proteobacterial diazotrophs and the multiple nifH/nifD paralogs retained in some of these organisms. Across the full NCBI Gene database, 375 nifH/nifD genes span 174 organisms, demonstrating that nitrogen fixation capability is phylogenetically scattered well beyond these four orders, including in diverse Archaea (e.g., Methanocaldococcus) and sulfate-reducing bacteria.

DSM 101043 (BacDive ID 131407) is documented to grow in Cyanobacteria Medium BG11-, which is a nitrogen-free medium used to induce heterocyst formation in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. A MediaDive query confirmed zero nitrogen-containing ingredients (no nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, or urea) in BG11-, establishing that the strain grows without any external fixed-nitrogen source. BG11- medium lacks fixed nitrogen sources, requiring nitrogen-fixing strains like Anabaena to form specialized heterocyst cells for atmospheric nitrogen fixation. This psychrophilic strain isolated from sediment can fix atmospheric nitrogen through the nitrogenase enzyme complex housed within heterocysts, specialized anaerobic cells that protect oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase from photosynthetic oxygen production. The cross-database integration between BacDive (strain characterization) and MediaDive (validated cultivation protocols) confirms this nitrogen-independent growth capability.
",True,6.41,"Anabaena sp. DSM 101043 is capable of growing in nitrogen-free BG11- medium due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen.

When cultured in BG11- medium (the nitrogen-depleted variant of standard BG11 medium that lacks combined nitrogen sources such as nitrate), Anabaena sp. DSM 101043 differentiates heterocysts along its filaments and converts atmospheric N₂ into ammonia through biological nitrogen fixation, thereby meeting its nitrogen requirements for growth.

The predominance of mupA in surveillance records reflects its plasmid-mediated transmissibility, which facilitates its spread among clinical MRSA lineages, whereas ileS mutations arise independently and are less common. The distinction between high-level (mupA) and low-level (ileS mutations) resistance has direct clinical implications, as high-level resistance compromises mupirocin use for MRSA decolonization regimens.

Regarding nucleotide cofactors, pyruvate carboxylase uses ATP (CHEBI:15422) to drive the carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, while the human GTP-dependent PEPCK isoform uses GTP (CHEBI:37565) to decarboxylate and phosphorylate oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate; the phosphohydrolases—fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase—require no nucleotide cofactor, instead cleaving phosphate ester bonds using water. In reviewed human UniProt entries, there is 1 protein for pyruvate carboxylase (PYC_HUMAN, P11498), 2 for GTP-dependent PEPCK (cytosolic PCKGC_HUMAN P35558 and mitochondrial PCKGM_HUMAN Q16822), 2 for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (liver F16P1_HUMAN P09467 and muscle F16P2_HUMAN O00757), and 3 for glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC1_HUMAN P35575, G6PC2_HUMAN Q9NQR9, and G6PC3_HUMAN Q9BUM1), giving 8 reviewed human proteins in total.

This substantial variant burden reflects KCNQ2's role as the causal gene for both the severe DEE7 (developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 7, MONDO:0013387) and the milder benign familial neonatal convulsions type 1, making it a major target of clinical sequencing in pediatric epilepsy. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 encode the Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits that co-assemble to form the neuronal M-channel responsible for regulating neuronal excitability; KCNQ2 variants are more frequently pathogenic and more clinically diverse in severity than KCNQ3 variants, which mainly cause the milder BFNC2 (MONDO:0007366). KCNT1 encodes the sodium-activated KNa1.1 (SLACK) channel and causes the severe epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS, MONDO:0100025), while KCNB1 encodes the Kv2.1 delayed-rectifier channel associated with DEE34 (MONDO:0014718); both have a smaller but clinically significant variant spectrum compared to KCNQ2.

This repertoire encompasses the full biochemical breadth of these enzymes beyond their nicotinate-specific roles: the pathway itself covers the Preiss-Handler route (nicotinate → NaMN → deamido-NAD+ → NAD+ via NAPRT, NMNAT1-3, and NADSYN1), the NAD+ salvage route (nicotinamide → NMN → NAD+ via NAMPT and NMNATs), and NAD+ consumption and recycling steps (CD38/BST1 glycohydrolases, NNMT methyltransferase, NT5E nucleotidase). The per-enzyme Rhea contribution varies widely: the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SLC5A8 (Q8N695) links to 14 approved reactions reflecting its broad substrate range for short-chain carboxylates including nicotinate, while NT5E/CD73 (P21589) contributes 10 reactions covering all its nucleoside monophosphate substrates. CD38 (P28907) accounts for 6 reactions including NAD+ glycohydrolase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, and cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase activities.

In the MeSH hierarchy, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (D020788) is classified simultaneously under congenital and hereditary ciliopathies (tree C16.131.077.245.125 and C16.320.184.125), retinitis pigmentosa within eye diseases (C11.270.684.624), and hypothalamic diseases (C10.228.140.617.200), reflecting the multi-system pathology of this ciliopathy. Together the eight genes harbor 7,800 distinct current ClinVar variants; BBS9 (1,283 variants) and BBS2 (1,258) carry the heaviest burdens, followed by BBS1 (1,193), BBS10 (1,007), BBS4 (900), BBS12 (868), BBS7 (849), and BBS5 (465, the lightest burden). By variant type, single nucleotide variants overwhelmingly dominate at 6,468 (83%), followed by deletions (666; 8.5%) and duplications (274; 3.5%). For clinical significance across all eight genes, the largest category is likely benign (2,808 variants), followed by variants of uncertain significance at 2,759, while pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and combined pathogenic/likely pathogenic entries total 1,638; 23 variants are counted in two BBS genes simultaneously, reflecting structural variants on chromosome 4 that overlap both BBS7 and BBS12.

The predominance of missense variants across these genes contributes to the high VUS rate, reflecting ongoing challenges in variant interpretation for BBS-associated genetic testing.

  - Chromosome 14","Chromosome 1 harbors the greatest number of protein-coding genes (15) associated with cardiomyopathy among all human chromosomes, based on reviewed human protein annotations. These 15 chromosome 1 genes span multiple cardiomyopathy-relevant functional categories: calcium handling and excitation-contraction coupling (RYR2, NEXN), sarcomere structure (ACTN2, TNNT2, TNNI3K, FPGT-TNNI3K), nuclear envelope integrity (LMNA, PSEN2), cell-cell communication (GJA5), natriuretic peptide signaling (NPPA), transcriptional regulation (PRDM16, RNF220, RRAGC, PPCS), and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (TRIM63). The next most populated chromosomes are chromosome 3 (11 genes, including SCN5A, CAV3, TNNC1, MYL3, KLHL24), chromosome 6 (9 genes, including DSP, PLN, EYA4, LAMA4, AARS2), and chromosome 12 (8 genes, including MYBPC3's binding partner TBX5, MYL2, ABCC9, PKP2).

The remaining 1,112 records (12.7%) have no resistancePhenotype value. Arithmetic verification: 2390 + 5255 + 13 + 1112 = 8,770 ✓. The most frequently resistant bacterial species are Escherichia coli (853 resistant isolates), Shigella sonnei (729), Salmonella enterica (334), Klebsiella pneumoniae (220), and Shigella flexneri (150); Staphylococcus aureus (33) and Enterococcus faecium also contribute. Taxonomically, the dominant resistant organisms—E. coli, Shigella, Klebsiella, and Salmonella—all belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria, whereas Staphylococcus aureus (family Staphylococcaceae) and Enterococcus faecium (family Enterococcaceae) represent Firmicutes exceptions. Genotypically, AMRportal contains 25,236 TRIMETHOPRIM-class resistance features; the predominant gene family is dhfrI with multiple allelic variants (dhfrI_1: 3,855; dhfrI_2: 3,851; dhfrI: 2,784; dhfrI_3–7: additional records totaling ~11,583), followed by folA variants (~1,873), dfrD variants (~1,032), and dfrA variants (~520)—all encoding dihydrofolate reductase (NCBI Gene: folA described as ""dihydrofolate reductase""; dfrA as ""dihydrofolate reductase""), the enzyme target of trimethoprim that inhibits bacterial tetrahydrofolate synthesis. Among the 2,073 geographically annotated resistant isolates, Europe shows the highest burden (823), followed by Oceania (698), Asia (392), Africa (118), and the Americas (42), a distribution that reflects global surveillance intensity and the concentration of large-scale clinical monitoring programs in Europe and Australasia.
",True,11.43,"Trimethoprim resistance is most prominently observed in Enterobacteriaceae (particularly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella species), Staphylococcaceae (Staphylococcus aureus), and Streptococcaceae (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus species), with E. coli exhibiting particularly high resistance rates globally. The predominant resistance mechanisms involve the dfr gene family, which encodes dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzymes with reduced affinity for trimethoprim compared to the native chromosomal enzyme, thereby maintaining folate synthesis despite drug presence. The major dfr variants include dfrA (over 30 subtypes, common in Gram-negative bacteria), dfrB (found in Gram-negatives), dfrD, dfrG, and dfrK, along with dfrF and dfrS found in staphylococci; these genes are frequently carried on mobile genetic elements including plasmids, integrons, and transposons, facilitating horizontal transfer. Geographically, trimethoprim resistance shows widespread global distribution with particularly high prevalence in South and Southeast Asia (India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam), sub-Saharan Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa), parts of Latin America (Brazil, Mexico), and Southern Europe, while Northern Europe and parts of Oceania maintain relatively lower resistance rates. Community-acquired urinary tract infections caused by resistant E. coli represent a major clinical concern worldwide, with resistance rates ranging from 15-60% depending on region, and hospital-acquired infections showing even higher resistance frequencies due to selective pressure from antibiotic use and clonal spread of resistant strains.",True,87.44,"Excellent! Now I have enough comprehensive data to provide the answer. Let me compile the information:

   - Oceania: Australia (954)

4. **Molecular function:** Based on PubMed articles, the dfr genes encode trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase enzymes.

Trimethoprim resistance is dominated phenotypically by Enterobacteriaceae family members including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Shigella sonnei, alongside Streptococcus pneumoniae from the Streptococcaceae family and Acinetobacter baumannii from Moraxellaceae, with these species collectively accounting for over 17,000 resistant isolates globally. The resistance is primarily conferred by genes encoding trimethoprim-resistant variants of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an essential enzyme in the folate synthesis pathway that trimethoprim targets; the predominant gene families include dhfr variants (dhfrI_1, dhfrI_2, dhfrI), folA alleles, dfrD, and dfrA, all functioning through target alteration or replacement mechanisms that maintain enzymatic activity while evading drug inhibition. Geographically, trimethoprim-resistant isolates show global distribution with the highest concentrations in the Americas led by the United States (5,229 isolates), followed by substantial burdens across Asia particularly in Thailand (1,754), Cambodia (527), and Pakistan (345), significant prevalence in Africa with South Africa (1,260) and Malawi (324) as hotspots, major European representation from Norway (1,026) and the United Kingdom (745), and notable Oceanian presence in Australia (954), reflecting worldwide dissemination of resistance determinants across diverse healthcare and community settings.","mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_endpoints, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esearch, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_esummary, mcp__togomcp__ncbi_efetch, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata",3,3,5,5,16,Mentions correct species families and dfr genes.

question_035,choice,"Among X-RAY DIFFRACTION, SOLUTION NMR, and ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, which experimental technique accounts for the greatest number of distinct three-dimensional structure entries for reviewed human serine proteases?

Choose one of the following options:
  - X-RAY DIFFRACTION
  - SOLUTION NMR
  - ELECTRON MICROSCOPY","X-RAY DIFFRACTION accounts for the greatest number of distinct structural entries for reviewed human serine proteases, with 1,880 PDB entries, vastly outnumbering ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (137 entries) and SOLUTION NMR (37 entries). This distribution was determined by cross-referencing the 141 reviewed human serine protease sequences from UniProt Swiss-Prot (keyword KW-0720, Homo sapiens) against all PDB entries via the UniProt accession links in the structure database. The total of 2,055 unique PDB entries spans five experimental techniques; two minor methods — ELECTRON CRYSTALLOGRAPHY (1 entry) and NEUTRON DIFFRACTION (1 entry) — also appear. The 2,056 method-level annotations for 2,055 unique entries indicate that one entry was deposited under two experimental methods (valid overlap). The overwhelming dominance of X-ray crystallography (91.5% of entries) reflects the historical tractability of serine proteases for crystal formation: their well-defined active-site geometry, availability of high-affinity inhibitor co-crystals, and pharmaceutical relevance as drug targets have driven decades of intensive crystallographic campaigns. Electron microscopy is still underrepresented for this family because most clinically relevant serine proteases are monomeric enzymes with molecular weights below ~100 kDa, at the lower end of optimal cryo-EM resolution, whereas solution NMR captures only the smaller members of the family.
",True,7.81,"**X-RAY DIFFRACTION**

X-ray crystallography (X-RAY DIFFRACTION) accounts for the vast majority of three-dimensional structure entries for reviewed human serine proteases in the Protein Data Bank. This dominance reflects both historical precedence and practical advantages: X-ray diffraction has been the primary structural biology technique since the mid-20th century and is particularly well-suited for studying serine proteases, which are typically small to medium-sized proteins (20-35 kDa for the catalytic domain) that readily crystallize. Notable examples include the extensive structural studies of thrombin, trypsin, plasmin, and coagulation factors, with hundreds of structures determined to characterize substrate specificity, inhibitor binding, and catalytic mechanisms. While solution NMR has contributed some serine protease structures, it is generally limited to smaller proteins and has been less widely applied to this protein family. Electron microscopy, though increasingly powerful for large macromolecular complexes, has contributed relatively few serine protease structures, as these proteins are often too small for traditional EM approaches and only recently accessible via cryo-EM at near-atomic resolution.",True,121.94,"**X-RAY DIFFRACTION**

X-ray diffraction accounts for the greatest number of distinct three-dimensional structure entries for reviewed human serine proteases with 1,741 unique PDB entries, compared to 110 for electron microscopy and 32 for solution NMR.

question_036,yes_no,Does the entry for metachromatic leukodystrophy in a major disease ontology cross-reference a clinical genetics concept in which Cholecystitis is documented as a clinical manifestation?,"Yes. Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MONDO:0018868), a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by arylsulfatase A (ARSA) deficiency, is cross-referenced in MONDO to the MedGen concept C0023522 via the UMLS identifier. In MedGen's MGREL database, this concept has 47 documented ""manifestation_of"" relationships, one of which links it to Cholecystitis (MedGen:C0008325). While metachromatic leukodystrophy is primarily known for progressive neurological manifestations — including peripheral demyelination, cerebellar ataxia, and intellectual disability — gallbladder involvement, including Cholecystitis and gallbladder dysfunction, is documented in the structured clinical data. This reflects the systemic nature of sulfatide accumulation in MLD: ARSA normally degrades sulfatides in lysosomes throughout the body, and excess sulfatide deposits in gallbladder epithelial cells and bile ducts can lead to cholecystitis and gallbladder polyps. This association is catalogued in MedGen's clinical knowledge graph but is not prominent in the standard biomedical literature, making it non-trivially verifiable without querying current structured databases.
",True,8.34,"I cannot provide a definitive answer to this specific question about cross-references between disease ontology entries and clinical genetics concepts regarding metachromatic leukodystrophy and cholecystitis. While metachromatic leukodystrophy is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by arylsulfatase A deficiency and is well-documented in major disease ontologies like OMIM, Orphanet, and the Human Phenotype Ontology, I do not have detailed knowledge of whether cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) is specifically documented as a clinical manifestation in the clinical genetics cross-references for this condition. Metachromatic leukodystrophy's primary clinical features involve progressive neurological deterioration, white matter abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathy, with gallbladder disease not being a commonly described or characteristic feature of this disorder. To answer whether a specific cross-reference exists between a disease ontology entry and a clinical genetics concept that documents cholecystitis as a manifestation would require direct access to the current database structures and cross-reference mappings of these resources, which I cannot verify with certainty from my training knowledge alone.",True,93.11,"Perfect!

Specifically, it states:

- ClinicalFeature uid=""920"" CUI=""C0008325"" - **Cholecystitis**: ""The presence of inflammatory changes in the gallbladder.""

Plec's exceptional transcript diversity reflects its unique genomic architecture: the mouse Plec gene encodes at least 11 alternative first exons (1a–1j and a common exon 2) that each splice into a shared downstream coding region, producing tissue-specific isoforms directed to distinct subcellular compartments — for example, isoform 1a targets hemidesmosomes in epithelia while isoform 1f localises to costameres and Z-discs in striated muscle. Dysf's 12 isoforms reflect alternative splicing of its tandem C2 domain array, relevant to its role in membrane repair at the sarcolemma. Capn3's 10 isoforms include the muscle-specific p94 form and lens isoform Lp82 arising from alternative promoter usage. By contrast, Lmna (4 isoforms, primarily lamin A and lamin C from alternative splicing at exon 10) and Ano5 (3 isoforms) are architecturally simpler. The striking isoform count difference between Plec and Ano5 (21 vs. 3) therefore does not reflect clinical severity but rather the mechanistic complexity of their membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding roles versus channel/lipid scramblase functions.

SCN5A encodes the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 and is the primary causal gene for Brugada syndrome, responsible for 15–30% of cases through loss-of-function variants; its ChEMBL entry reflects its central role as a drug target for antiarrhythmic compounds and as a cardiac safety liability. The potassium channels KCNH2 (hERG) and KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) are prominent ChEMBL targets because inhibition of hERG is a major mechanism of drug-induced QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. CACNA1C encodes the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2, a target for dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. RYR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) is targeted by flecainide and other agents used in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, a related channelopathy with substantial overlap in the research literature.

Nine of the 10 reactions are catalyzed by MenA-type 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate octaprenyltransferases: one generic reaction covers all-trans-polyprenyl chain lengths (RHEA:26478), and eight chain-length-specific reactions cover hexaprenyl (MK-6), heptaprenyl (MK-7), octaprenyl (MK-8), nonaprenyl (MK-9), decaprenyl (MK-10), undecaprenyl (MK-11), dodecaprenyl (MK-12), and tridecaprenyl (MK-13) diphosphates as cosubstrates, each producing the corresponding demethylmenaquinol and releasing CO2 and diphosphate.

Three of the four characterized siglecs (SIGLEC5, 7, 8) are CD33-related inhibitory receptors carrying cytoplasmic ITIMs, while SIGLEC14 is an activating receptor paired with DAP12; all four are expressed primarily on myeloid or NK cells and play roles in immune tolerance, allergy regulation, and innate immune modulation. Dense N-glycosylation of siglec ectodomains is biologically significant because the glycan shield can occlude the V-set sialic acid-binding domain, favoring cis-ligand masking on the cell surface over trans-ligand engagement, and modulating receptor clustering and signaling thresholds.

question_045,summary,"What are the structural characteristics of 3-demethylubiquinones as intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis, and how are they enzymatically converted to ubiquinones?","3-Demethylubiquinones are penultimate intermediates in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway that differ from their mature ubiquinone counterparts by a single structural feature: a free hydroxyl group (-OH) at ring position 3 instead of the methoxyl group (-OCH3) found in ubiquinones, classifying them ontologically as monohydroxy-1,4-benzoquinones within the broader ubiquinone family. This single substituent difference translates to a molecular mass difference of approximately 14 Da for each chain-length variant; for example, 3-demethylubiquinone-9 has the molecular formula C53H80O4 with a molecular weight of 781.2 Da (compared to 795.2 Da for ubiquinone-9), while 3-demethylubiquinone-10 has the formula C58H88O4 with a molecular weight of 849.3 Da (compared to 863.3 Da for coenzyme Q10). Their conversion to ubiquinones is catalyzed by SAM-dependent O-methyltransferases in a reaction where S-adenosyl-L-methionine donates a methyl group to the hydroxyl at position 3, yielding the corresponding ubiquinol (reduced) or ubiquinone (oxidized) product along with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. The Rhea database catalogues 7 approved reactions of this type, comprising 2 generic reactions covering the entire class of 3-demethylubiquinone and 3-demethylubiquinol species and 5 chain-length-specific reactions for the n=6, n=7, n=8, n=9, and n=10 polyprenyl variants that predominate across different organisms.
",True,8.96,"3-Demethylubiquinones are key intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis that possess a benzoquinone ring system with a polyisoprenoid tail but lack a methyl group at the C3 position of the quinone head group. Structurally, these compounds feature methoxy groups at the C2 and C5 positions (or their hydroxyl precursors) and retain the characteristic isoprenoid side chain whose length varies by organism (Q6-Q10 in different species). The conversion of 3-demethylubiquinones to mature ubiquinones requires the addition of a methyl group at the C3 position, catalyzed by a specific methyltransferase enzyme known as UbiG in bacteria or COQ3 in eukaryotes. This enzyme utilizes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor, transferring the methyl group to the C3 carbon of the benzoquinone ring through a nucleophilic substitution mechanism. The methylation reaction represents one of the final steps in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway, occurring after the prenylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate and subsequent hydroxylation and methylation reactions at other positions on the quinone ring. The resulting ubiquinone molecules possess the complete complement of substituents necessary for their function as mobile electron carriers in the respiratory chain, with the C3 methyl group contributing to the hydrophobic character and proper redox potential of the coenzyme.",True,114.16,"3-Demethylubiquinones are intermediates in ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) biosynthesis characterized by a benzoquinone core with a single methoxy group at position 2, a hydroxyl group at position 4, and a long isoprenoid side chain at position 5, differing from ubiquinones by lacking the methoxy group at position 3. The chemical structure of 3-demethylubiquinone-9 (C53H80O4, molecular mass 781.2 Da) exemplifies this class with its monohydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone core and nine isoprenoid units in the side chain. These compounds are enzymatically converted to ubiquinones through a methylation reaction catalyzed by ubiquinone biosynthesis O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.64, EC 2.1.1.114), which uses S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor to methylate the 3-position hydroxyl group of 3-demethylubiquinones, producing ubiquinones and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine as products. This O-methyltransferase catalyzes the final step of ubiquinone biosynthesis and also functions in an earlier step by methylating 3,4-dihydroxy-5-polyprenylbenzoic acid to form 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-polyprenylbenzoic acid, making it essential for two non-consecutive methylation steps in the pathway. The enzyme can also methylate the reduced form (3-demethylubiquinol) to produce ubiquinol, demonstrating substrate flexibility for both oxidized and reduced intermediates in mitochondrial ubiquinone biosynthesis.","mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__ols__search, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_molecule, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",3,4,4,5,16,"Has structural difference (C3 methyl), SAM donor, UbiG/COQ3.

question_046,yes_no,"Does AXIN1, the scaffold protein that nucleates the beta-catenin destruction complex in canonical Wnt signaling, have a phosphorylated form with specifically annotated concurrent phosphorylation at threonine and serine residues documented in any curated human Wnt pathway entry?","AXIN1 (UniProt O15169, AXIN1_HUMAN), a manually reviewed human protein, does indeed have a phosphorylated form with specifically annotated concurrent threonine and serine modifications curated in the Reactome human pathway database. The phosphorylated isoform designated p-T481,S486,S493-AXIN1 carries three co-occurring modifications: O-phospho-L-threonine at position 481 and O-phospho-L-serine at positions 486 and 493. These phosphorylation events are documented within the curated biochemical reaction ""AXIN is phosphorylated in the destruction complex"" (R-HSA-5229343), which is a component of the human pathway ""Degradation of beta-catenin by the destruction complex"" (R-HSA-195253), itself nested within the broader ""Signaling by WNT"" hierarchy (R-HSA-195721). Mechanistically, the destruction complex—assembled by AXIN1 as scaffold, together with APC, CK1, and GSK3-beta—sequentially phosphorylates beta-catenin to mark it for proteasomal degradation; the phosphorylation of AXIN1 itself at T481, S486, and S493 enhances its stability within the complex and potentiates beta-catenin turnover, thereby maintaining the off-state of canonical Wnt signaling in the absence of Wnt ligand.
",True,9.21,"AXIN1, which serves as the central scaffold protein for the β-catenin destruction complex in canonical Wnt signaling, undergoes multiple post-translational modifications including phosphorylation at both serine and threonine residues. The protein contains numerous documented phosphorylation sites that have been identified through mass spectrometry and other proteomic approaches. Specifically, AXIN1 is phosphorylated by several kinases including GSK3β and CK1α, which themselves are components of the destruction complex. These phosphorylation events occur at multiple serine and threonine residues throughout the protein and regulate AXIN1's stability, localization, and interaction with other destruction complex components such as APC, GSK3β, and β-catenin itself. Curated pathway databases including Reactome, KEGG, and WikiPathways document AXIN1 phosphorylation states in their Wnt signaling pathway entries, with specific annotations indicating concurrent phosphorylation at multiple serine and threonine sites. These modifications are functionally significant as they modulate AXIN1's scaffolding activity and the overall efficiency of β-catenin degradation. The phosphorylation pattern is dynamic and context-dependent, changing in response to Wnt pathway activation status, where Wnt ligand binding leads to alterations in AXIN1 phosphorylation that contribute to destruction complex disassembly and subsequent β-catenin stabilization.",True,105.89,"Yes, AXIN1 has a documented phosphorylated form with concurrent phosphorylation at both threonine and serine residues in curated human Wnt pathway entries in Reactome.

This multiply phosphorylated AXIN1 is explicitly annotated in the ""Signaling by WNT"" pathway (Reactome pathway R-HSA-195721) and appears as a component of the beta-catenin destruction complex following the biochemical reaction ""AXIN is phosphorylated in the destruction complex."" The pathway containing this phosphorylated AXIN1 form is annotated with Gene Ontology term GO:0016055 (Wnt signaling pathway) and represents the canonical Wnt signaling cascade in Homo sapiens, confirming that this specific phosphorylation pattern of AXIN1—featuring concurrent threonine and serine phosphorylation—is documented in the context of its role as the scaffold protein nucleating the beta-catenin destruction complex.","mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_sparql_endpoints, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__ols__fetch",3,4,4,5,16,"Correct yes, mentions GSK3β/CK1α phosphorylation and Reactome/KEGG.

question_050,choice,"Among Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which species has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records?

Choose one of the following options:
  - Klebsiella pneumoniae
  - Acinetobacter baumannii
  - Salmonella enterica
  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Salmonella enterica has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records, with 23 distinct classes, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16), and Acinetobacter baumannii (14). The 28 total unique classes across all four species (sum of per-species counts = 75; 75 > 28, indicating 47 class-instances are shared, with core classes such as BETA-LACTAM, AMINOGLYCOSIDE, QUINOLONE, TETRACYCLINE, and SULFONAMIDE present in all four species) reflects extensive horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants among Gram-negative pathogens. Salmonella enterica's broader drug-class repertoire is consistent with its diverse ecological niches spanning human clinical, livestock, and environmental reservoirs, which expose bacterial populations to a wide range of selective antibiotic pressures and facilitate acquisition of resistance genes from taxonomically distant organisms; distinctive Salmonella classes include BLEOMYCIN, STREPTOTHRICIN, RIFAMYCIN, FOSFOMYCIN, and GLYCOPEPTIDE. Notably, this class-breadth ranking diverges from gene-symbol diversity: K. pneumoniae has substantially more distinct gene symbols in AMRPortal but a narrower class range than Salmonella by just one class, reflecting K. pneumoniae's depth in a few resistance mechanisms (especially BETA-LACTAM diversity via ESBLs and carbapenemases) rather than breadth across classes. Acinetobacter baumannii, despite its clinical reputation as extensively drug-resistant, shows the fewest distinct drug classes (14) among the four ESKAPE pathogens in current surveillance records, as its resistance phenotype is largely driven by a concentrated set of OXA-type carbapenemases and efflux pump mechanisms rather than broad class diversification.
",True,7.92,"**Klebsiella pneumoniae** is correct.

Klebsiella pneumoniae has the greatest diversity of resistance mechanisms represented in genotypic surveillance records among these four species. This organism harbors resistance genes spanning the broadest range of antibiotic classes including beta-lactams (including carbapenems via multiple mechanisms like KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like carbapenemases), aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, fosfomycin, colistin (mcr genes), and macrolides. K. pneumoniae's remarkable capacity for horizontal gene transfer and its role as a major reservoir of mobile genetic elements carrying resistance determinants has led to extensive documentation of resistance genes across virtually all major antibiotic classes used in clinical practice. While P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii are also highly resistant pathogens, their intrinsic resistance profiles and acquired mechanisms cover somewhat fewer distinct drug classes in typical surveillance databases. Salmonella enterica, though capable of multidrug resistance, generally shows resistance to a more limited spectrum of antibiotic classes compared to K. pneumoniae's exceptionally diverse resistome documented in global surveillance programs.",True,29.52,"**Salmonella enterica**
