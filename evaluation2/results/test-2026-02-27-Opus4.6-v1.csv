question_004,summary,Summarize the distribution of melatonin biosynthesis enzymes across species and characterize their molecular functions and the chemical intermediates involved.,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes are distributed across 16 species spanning three kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi), with 33 reviewed proteins in total. Mammals account for 14 proteins across 9 taxa, including two human paralogs (AANAT and ASMT), with coverage extending to mouse, rat, cattle, sheep, macaque, hamster, chimpanzee, and Mus musculus molossinus. Plants contribute 14 proteins from 4 taxa: Arabidopsis thaliana (4 proteins), Oryza sativa subsp. japonica (7 proteins, the most of any single organism), Oryza sativa subsp. indica (1 protein), and Zea mays (2 proteins). Additional representatives include two bird proteins in Gallus gallus, two insect proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, and one fungal protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The pathway proceeds through two enzymatic steps acting on distinct chemical intermediates: first, aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT, GO:0004059, a subclass of N-acetyltransferase activity) converts serotonin (CHEBI:28790, C10H12N2O) to N-acetylserotonin (CHEBI:17697, C12H14N2O2); then acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT, GO:0017096, a subclass of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity) converts N-acetylserotonin to melatonin (CHEBI:16796, C13H16N2O2). Exactly 17 proteins are annotated with AANAT activity and 16 with ASMT activity, with no overlap. This enzymatic conservation across evolutionarily distant taxa — from yeast to plants to mammals — indicates an ancient origin of the two-step melatonin biosynthesis mechanism, with the pathway starting from tryptophan (CHEBI:27897, C11H12N2O2) via serotonin as the upstream precursor.
",True,11.9,"Melatonin biosynthesis enzymes show wide phylogenetic distribution across bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals, though their presence and specific forms vary considerably among lineages. The canonical melatonin biosynthetic pathway involves four sequential enzymatic steps beginning with the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) first converts tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is then decarboxylated by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) to produce serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). Serotonin serves as the substrate for arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), which acetylates serotonin to form N-acetylserotonin, the penultimate intermediate. Finally, hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), also called acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT), catalyzes the O-methylation of N-acetylserotonin using S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). In vertebrates, AANAT is typically the rate-limiting enzyme and is highly expressed in the pineal gland, whereas plants possess multiple AANAT-like and ASMT-like enzymes with broader tissue distribution. Alternative pathways exist in some organisms where the acetylation and methylation steps occur in reverse order, producing 5-methoxytryptamine as an intermediate instead of N-acetylserotonin. The enzymes show functional conservation in their core catalytic mechanisms but differ substantially in regulatory properties, tissue localization, and substrate specificity across species, reflecting independent evolutionary origins in some lineages and diverse physiological roles beyond circadian regulation.",333,419,0.007284,True,166.45,"Based on the comprehensive database queries, I now have sufficient information to provide a complete answer about melatonin biosynthesis enzymes.

Melatonin biosynthesis involves two principal enzymes that convert serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) to melatonin through sequential chemical modifications. Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.87, also called arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase) catalyzes the first step by transferring an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to serotonin, producing N-acetylserotonin and coenzyme A as products. Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.4, also known as hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase) performs the second step by transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to N-acetylserotonin, yielding melatonin along with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and a proton. These enzymes are distributed across diverse taxonomic groups, with 18 reviewed proteins found in animals (Metazoa), including humans, mice, rats, chickens, cattle, sheep, and primates, 12 in plants (Viridiplantae), particularly in chloroplast-localized forms in species like Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), and 1 in fungi, specifically an indolamine N-acetyltransferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The molecular functions of these enzymes involve specific substrate recognition and cofactor binding, with the acetyltransferase utilizing acetyl-CoA as the acetyl donor and the methyltransferase employing S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor, both operating through nucleophilic substitution mechanisms. The chemical pathway progresses from the aromatic amine serotonin (C₁₀H₁₂N₂O) through the acetylated intermediate N-acetylserotonin (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₂) to the final methylated product melatonin (C₁₃H₁₆N₂O₂), with each enzymatic step adding structural modifications that transform the neurotransmitter precursor into the hormone that regulates circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles.",37,3422,0.5252342,0.532518,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__ols__search, mcp__ols__fetch, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__ols__search, mcp__ols__search, mcp__ols__search",3,3,4,4,14,Mentions correct pathway steps (tryptophan→serotonin→N-acetylserotonin→melatonin) but incorrectly describes 4 steps instead of 2 key enzymes (AANAT/ASMT).

question_005,choice,"Among the following kinase groups — AGC, CAMK, CMGC, and TK — which has the greatest number of human protein targets with experimentally determined X-ray crystal structures deposited in the PDB?

Choose one of the following options:
  - AGC
  - CAMK
  - CMGC
  - TK","TK (tyrosine kinases) has the greatest number of human protein targets with
PDB X-ray crystal structures, with 2,280 structures across 80 ChEMBL-classified
human targets. CMGC ranks second (1,539 structures, 58 targets), followed by
CAMK (734 structures, 65 targets) and AGC (422 structures, 59 targets).

TK dominates structural coverage because tyrosine kinases are the primary targets
in cancer drug discovery. The EGFR family alone (EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4) accounts
for hundreds of entries; BCR-ABL1 (P00519) has over 200 structures due to
imatinib-resistance studies; VEGFR2/KDR (P35968), ALK (Q9UM73), c-MET (P08581),
RET (P07949), FGFR1-4, and the SRC family kinases each contribute dozens to
hundreds of structures. The pharmaceutical industry's intense focus on TK
inhibitors for oncology has driven an outsized crystallographic effort relative
to the number of targets.

CMGC ranks second because it includes intensively studied targets: CDK2 (P24941)
alone has over 400 PDB structures from fragment-based and structure-based drug
design campaigns; CDK4/6 (cyclin-dependent kinases), CDK8, CDK9, MAPK1/ERK2
(P28482), MAPK14/p38α (Q16539), GSK3B (P49841), and DYRK1A (Q13627) are all
major drug targets with large structural datasets.

CAMK ranks third despite having the most targets (65) among the four groups,
because many CAMK members (e.g., CaM kinases, DAPK, CHK1, CHK2) are less
pharmacologically tractable or have been structurally solved fewer times.

AGC ranks last (422 structures) despite its prominent members (AKT1/2/3, PKCα,
PKA, RSK1-4, S6K1) because several AGC kinases proved challenging for structural
biology due to flexibility or membrane association, and the group has fewer
members overall.

A note on cross-group overlap: 70 PDB structures (1.4%) contain proteins with
dual classification in ChEMBL (6 proteins annotated as both AGC and CAMK). These
structures are counted in both groups' totals. This overlap does not affect the
answer — TK leads CMGC by 741 structures, far exceeding the 70-structure overlap.
",True,6.31,"The correct answer is **TK (Tyrosine Kinase)**.

The TK group has the greatest number of human protein targets with experimentally determined X-ray crystal structures in the PDB. This predominance reflects the extensive structural biology efforts directed toward tyrosine kinases due to their critical roles in cell signaling and their importance as drug targets, particularly in cancer therapy. The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as therapeutics has driven intensive crystallographic studies to understand ligand binding, activation mechanisms, and resistance mutations. While the AGC, CAMK, and CMGC groups also contain important kinases with numerous structures deposited, the TK group's therapeutic relevance has resulted in a disproportionately large number of crystal structures, including multiple structures of key targets like EGFR, ABL, SRC, and various receptor tyrosine kinases in different conformational states and with diverse inhibitors bound.",256,203,0.003813,True,401.81,"Based on the results I've gathered:

- CMGC: 24 + 18 = 42 unique proteins with X-ray structures
- TK: 27 + 20 + 7 = 54 unique proteins with X-ray structures (and I'm still missing a few)

TK appears to have the most. Let me verify by counting total distinct targets per group from my initial ChEMBL query to get a complete picture:

From my earlier ChEMBL query results (limit 500), I can count:
- TK appears 80 times
- AGC appears 54 times
- CAMK appears 64 times
- CMGC appears 58 times

The TK group is clearly the largest. Based on my PDB queries, TK has at least 54 unique human protein targets with X-ray structures, which is higher than AGC (38), CAMK (42), and CMGC (42).

**TK**

The TK (tyrosine kinase) group has the greatest number of human protein targets with experimentally determined X-ray crystal structures deposited in the PDB. Based on systematic queries of ChEMBL protein classifications and PDB X-ray crystallography data for human proteins, TK kinases have at least 54 unique protein targets with X-ray structures, compared to AGC (38 targets), CAMK (42 targets), and CMGC (42 targets).

The intersection — proteins that are both ChEMBL drug targets and structurally characterized — is 69, representing 75% structural coverage of the metalloprotease drug target space. This high coverage reflects the pharmaceutical importance of metalloproteases, particularly matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), ADAMs, and aminopeptidases, which are extensively pursued for cancer, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease.

Across all three categories, Firmicutes is the dominant phylum, contributing 2,096 anaerobes, 1,686 facultative anaerobes, and 94 obligate anaerobes; Proteobacteria ranks second among anaerobes (810) and ties with Firmicutes among facultative anaerobes (1,683); Actinobacteria accounts for 676 anaerobes and 490 facultative anaerobes, while Bacteroidetes contributes 351 anaerobes and 111 facultative anaerobes. At the order level, Lactobacillales leads with 1,557 strains, followed by Clostridiales (861), Enterobacterales (741), Actinomycetales (557), and Eubacteriales (409). Temperature data from BacDive's structured CultureTemperature records show that general anaerobes (4,707 strains with temperature data) grow across an extraordinarily broad range of −2 to 103°C with an average optimum near 36.4°C, facultative anaerobes (4,224 strains) span 0–90°C with a cooler mean of 26.8°C reflecting their greater ecological breadth, and obligate anaerobes (216 strains) average 36.9°C with a range of −1.8 to 112°C indicating adaptation to extreme environments. Cross-database integration with MediaDive identifies 4,984 anaerobic strains with linked medium records; the most commonly used media are Columbia Blood Medium (744 strains), EG Medium (402), Trypticase Soy Yeast Extract Medium (357), PYG Medium modified (330), and BL Agar (249), reflecting the nutritionally rich, reduced-oxygen formulations required by these organisms.

These organisms exhibit varying oxygen tolerance characteristics, categorized as obligate anaerobes that cannot survive oxygen exposure (such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species), aerotolerant anaerobes that survive but do not use oxygen for growth (like many Propionibacterium species), and facultative anaerobes that can grow with or without oxygen (including some Actinomyces species). Typical culture conditions for anaerobic bacteria require oxygen-free environments maintained through anaerobic chambers, jars with gas-generating systems, or pre-reduced media, with incubation temperatures generally ranging from 35-37°C for human-associated species and variable temperatures for environmental isolates. Growth media commonly include enriched formulations such as brain-heart infusion, thioglycollate broth, or blood agar plates, supplemented with reducing agents like cysteine, sodium thioglycollate, or resazurin as oxygen indicators, while vitamin K and hemin are added for fastidious species.

question_009,list,Which human enzymes with catalytic roles in the leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway are documented drug targets in ChEMBL with mechanism-of-action records?,"Five of the eight human enzymes with catalytic roles in the Reactome leukotriene and eoxin biosynthesis pathway have mechanism-of-action records in ChEMBL. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, CHEMBL215) has the most ChEMBL mechanism records of any pathway enzyme, with eight drugs documented as inhibitors, including zileuton (phase 4), the only FDA-approved drug specifically indicated for asthma that acts by reversibly inhibiting this rate-limiting step in leukotriene synthesis, as well as five other phase-4 anti-inflammatory agents (mesalamine, sulfasalazine, balsalazide disodium, olsalazine sodium, meclofenamate sodium) and two phase-2 clinical candidates (PF-4191834, atreleuton). The 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (ALOX5AP/FLAP, CHEMBL4550) is the most clinically active target, with three distinct phase-3 clinical inhibitors — fiboflapon, fiboflapon sodium, and veliflapon — all documented as INHIBITOR mechanisms. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H, CHEMBL4618), which converts LTA4 to the potent chemoattractant LTB4, is targeted by acebilustat at phase 2. The multidrug resistance-associated protein ABCC1/MRP1 (CHEMBL3004), which exports LTC4 across the cell membrane as part of the pathway, is targeted by the phase-2 multidrug resistance modulator biricodar. MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2, CHEMBL2208), which activates ALOX5 via phosphorylation, is targeted at phase 1 by AT-13148, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor. Three pathway enzymes — arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1), and leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) — lack ChEMBL mechanism records despite participating in the pathway, reflecting their lower prioritisation as drug targets in clinical development programmes.

Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX/ALOX5) is a primary target, catalyzing the first committed step in leukotriene synthesis by converting arachidonic acid to leukotriene A4, and is targeted by inhibitors such as zileuton. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) converts leukotriene A4 to leukotriene B4 and serves as a drug target. Leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione to leukotriene A4 to form leukotriene C4 and is documented as a target in drug discovery efforts. Additionally, arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX/ALOX15) plays a catalytic role in eoxin biosynthesis through the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which can be further metabolized to eoxins, and has drug target records in ChEMBL. Gamma-glutamyltransferase 5 (GGT5) and dipeptidase 1 (DPEP1), which sequentially convert leukotriene C4 to leukotriene D4 and then to leukotriene E4, are also documented in medicinal chemistry contexts, though they receive less attention as therapeutic targets compared to the upstream enzymes in the pathway.",344,396,0.006972,True,138.26,"I already have all the information I need from my previous queries.

- LTC4S (Q16873) - converts LTA4 to LTC4, and EXA4 to EXC4
- LTA4H (P09960) - converts LTA4 to LTB4
- ALOX15 (P16050) - converts LTA4 to EXA4
- ALOX12 (P18054) - converts LTA4 to lipoxins (LXA4, LXB4)

Leukotriene A-4 hydrolase (LTA4H, EC 3.3.2.6) catalyzes the hydrolysis of leukotriene A4 to leukotriene B4, a potent chemoattractant, and has one documented mechanism with acebilustat as an inhibitor. Polyunsaturated fatty acid lipoxygenase ALOX12 (EC 1.13.11.31) catalyzes the oxidation of leukotriene A4 to lipoxins A4 and B4, which are specialized pro-resolving mediators, and has one documented mechanism with benoxaprofen as an inhibitor. In contrast, leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S, EC 4.4.1.20), which conjugates glutathione to both leukotriene A4 and 15-epi-leukotriene A4 to form leukotriene C4 and eoxin C4 respectively, and arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15, EC 1.13.11.33), which converts leukotriene A4 to 15-epi-leukotriene A4 (eoxin A4), are present in ChEMBL as targets but have no documented mechanism-of-action records.",39,5723,0.60125475,0.608227,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_target, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_target, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",3,3,5,4,15,"Lists ALOX5 with zileuton (correct), LTA4H (correct), LTC4S (not in ideal's MoA list), ALOX15 (not in ideal's MoA list), GGT5 and DPEP1 (not in ideal pathway).

This substantially exceeds connective tissue disorder (134 TopicalDescriptors), autoimmune disease (61 TopicalDescriptors), and rheumatic disorder (39 TopicalDescriptors). The counts reflect confirmed joins with the MeSH RDF graph restricted to meshv:TopicalDescriptor entries (i.e., canonical MeSH headings used for indexing); MONDO cross-references to MeSH supplementary concept records (MESH:C...) are excluded. The four categories are not mutually exclusive: immune system disorder is the broadest and contains the other three as subcategories, so their diseases are counted within it as well — the sum across categories (482) exceeds the 346 unique diseases with TopicalDescriptor mappings due to this intentional overlap in the ontology hierarchy. The higher absolute count for immune system disorder reflects its greater scope rather than a higher per-disease mapping rate, since autoimmune disease and rheumatic disorder actually have proportionally good coverage relative to their size.

This category includes not only SLE itself but numerous other collagen vascular diseases, mixed connective tissue disease, scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and various overlap syndromes that share pathophysiological features with lupus. While autoimmune diseases and immune system disorders are also parent categories of SLE, the connective tissue diseases branch in MeSH tends to contain more specifically defined disease entities with established descriptor mappings, as it represents a more clinically and pathologically coherent grouping of disorders that share tissue involvement patterns and often overlapping clinical manifestations.",242,227,0.004131,True,52.1,"Perfect!

Filtering for PubChem compounds (those with URIs starting with ""http://rdf.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/compound/"") that are typed by any of these 64 ChEBI classes yields 24 distinct compounds. These include central pathway intermediates such as protoporphyrinogen IX, Mg-protoporphyrin IX, and various chlorophyllide derivatives, as well as cofactors like NADPH, ATP, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The substantially smaller number of PubChem entries relative to ChEBI classes reflects the fact that many highly specific tetrapyrrole intermediates and bacteriochlorophyll precursors, though well-defined in ChEBI, do not yet have curated entries in PubChem.

Decorin is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan bearing glycosylation at six distinct amino acid positions: 34, 115, 211, 255, 262, and 303. The database records 286 total glycosylation site entries for decorin, reflecting the multiple glycan structures (glycoforms) annotated at individual positions — position 211 alone carries 132 distinct glycoform entries and position 262 carries 121, indicating extensive N-glycan microheterogeneity at these asparagine residues. The site at position 34 corresponds to the canonical glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin/dermatan sulfate) attachment serine characteristic of the proteoglycan core protein. This rich glycosylation complexity is consistent with decorin's biological roles in extracellular matrix organization, collagen fibrillogenesis, and TGF-β sequestration, where the glycan chains modulate protein–protein interactions and tissue hydration.
",True,8.12,"I cannot directly access the GlyCosmos database or any other external databases to verify the current documentation status of glycosylation sites for human decorin (UniProt:P07585).

The taxonomic distribution reveals that hormone proteins are predominantly found in mammals, with Mus musculus (138 proteins), Homo sapiens (134 proteins), and Rattus norvegicus (123 proteins) representing the top three species. Significant representation is also observed in other vertebrates (83 proteins in Bos taurus, 67 in Sus scrofa), insects (39 in Drosophila melanogaster, 37 in Bombyx mori), and notably in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (57 proteins), reflecting the evolutionary conservation and diversification of hormonal signaling systems across eukaryotes.

question_015,summary,"Characterize the reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 across three dimensions: their GO-annotated functional module assignments (capsid, baseplate, and tail components); any enzymatic activities encoded among these otherwise structural late proteins; and their experimental structural coverage, including the relative proportions of cryo-electron microscopy versus X-ray crystallography depositions.","The 25 reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4, all annotated with KW-0426, collectively encode the phage's iconic contractile tail-injection nanomachine and partition into four major GO-defined structural modules: the capsid (2 proteins: CAPSH/major capsid protein, CAPSP/capsid vertex), the baseplate (11 proteins: the ten wedge and hub assembly proteins gp7, gp10, gp25, gp27, gp48, gp53, gp54, gp26, gp28, gp51, plus the pre-baseplate central spike gp5), the tail tube and completion system (4 proteins: gp19 tube, tail tube terminator, tape-measure protein, gp15 tail completion protein), and the tail fibers (5 proteins: short fiber gp12, three long-fiber subunits gp35/gp36/gp37, and the long-fiber proximal subunit), with the structural collar protein fibritin (WAC) and two DNA helicase isoforms (uvsW and uvsW1) completing the set. Enzymatically, two late proteins break the ""purely structural"" expectation: gp5 (NEEDL_BPT4) bears lysozyme activity (GO:0003796) that hydrolyzes peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall to puncture the host envelope during injection, while the uvsW DNA helicases (GO:0043138, 3'-5' DNA helicase activity) drive late-phase recombination and repair, a function unusual for proteins expressed after DNA replication has begun. Of the 25 proteins, 17 (68%) are structurally characterized in PDB via at least one entry, yielding 149 distinct structures (103 by cryo-electron microscopy, 44 by X-ray crystallography, 2 by solution NMR); because T4 assemblies are large multi-subunit complexes—the baseplate alone contains 11 late proteins—the same PDB entry frequently references multiple T4 proteins, producing 182 total protein-to-entry attributions for 149 distinct structures (33 attribution counts arise from co-occurrence in assemblies). The striking dominance of cryo-EM (69% of entries) reflects the field's shift toward studying intact viral assemblies: fibritin alone accounts for 104 of these entries due to its adoption as an engineering scaffold, while the gp5 spike (18 entries) and major capsid protein (9 entries) follow; the eight structurally uncharacterized proteins—most notably the three baseplate hub proteins gp26, gp28, and gp51, the two long tail-fiber subunits gp35 and gp36, and the two uvsW helicase isoforms—represent current frontiers in T4 structural biology.
",True,14.7,"The late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 comprise approximately 40 reviewed structural components that partition into three major GO-annotated functional modules: the capsid (including gp23 major capsid protein, gp24 vertex protein, gp20 portal protein, and gp hoc/soc decorating proteins), the tail tube and sheath (gp19, gp18, gp3, gp15, and tail-associated components), and the elaborate baseplate complex (gp5-gp12, gp25, gp27, gp29, gp48, gp53, gp54). Despite their predominantly structural roles, several late proteins possess enzymatic activities: gp5 functions as the central tail spike with endorhamnosidase activity that degrades host lipopolysaccharide; gp12 exhibits short tail fiber component with peptidoglycan hydrolase activity; the tape measure protein (gp29) and certain baseplate proteins contain catalytic domains for host cell wall degradation during infection. Structural coverage of these proteins has expanded significantly, with approximately 60-70% now having experimentally determined structures deposited in the PDB. The structural methodologies show distinct historical and size-dependent patterns: smaller baseplate components and isolated domains were initially solved predominantly by X-ray crystallography (representing roughly 40-45% of depositions), while the large macromolecular assemblies including the complete capsid, baseplate wedge complexes, and tail structures have been resolved almost exclusively through cryo-electron microscopy since 2010, particularly at resolutions below 4Å, with cryo-EM now accounting for 55-60% of structural depositions. The baseplate assembly represents one of the most comprehensively characterized molecular machines, with nearly complete structural coverage of its constituent proteins achieved through combined crystallographic and cryo-EM approaches.",383,417,0.007404,True,99.58,"Perfect! Now I have comprehensive data. Let me analyze this data to provide a complete answer. Based on my queries, I've found:

   - Other proteins: varying coverage
   - Methods: Predominantly X-ray crystallography, with increasing cryo-EM in recent years

Now let me count the exact method distributions:

Based on the comprehensive data retrieved, the reviewed late proteins of Enterobacteria phage T4 comprise 25 structurally characterized proteins segregated into three GO-annotated functional modules: the capsid assembly (major capsid protein P04535, vertex protein P19896, and decoration proteins SOC P03715 and HOC P18056), the baseplate complex (wedge proteins P10927-P10929, P19060-P19062, P16011, P09425; hub component P17172; and central spike proteins P16009 and P17172), and tail components (sheath P13332, tube P13333, long tail fibers P03744, P03742, P03743, P18771, short tail fiber P10930, and fibritin P10104). Among these predominantly structural proteins, two possess enzymatic activities annotated with lysozyme function (EC 3.2.1.17): endolysin P00720, which facilitates host lysis during progeny release, and the baseplate spike protein P16009 (gp5), which catalyzes peptidoglycan hydrolysis during infection to enable DNA ejection through the host cell wall. Experimental structural coverage is highly asymmetric, dominated by the endolysin P00720 with approximately 580 deposited structures making it one of the most extensively characterized proteins in the PDB, while the remaining 24 late proteins collectively contribute roughly 180 structures; the methodological distribution reflects the historical timeline of structural biology, with X-ray crystallography accounting for approximately 95% of all depositions (predominantly lysozyme structures solved between 1965-2020), while cryo-electron microscopy represents the remaining 5% concentrated in structures deposited after 2015, including complete virion assemblies (5VF3, 6UZC, 8GMO), baseplate subcomplexes (5IV5, 5IV7, 5HX2), and tail structures (3J2M, 3J2N, 7QDG-7QUS series) that capture these proteins in their native oligomeric states.",29,3337,0.6990379500000001,0.706442,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_uniprot_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__search_pdb_entity, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",3,3,4,3,13,Lists ~40 proteins (ideal says 25).

This order, which includes well-studied nitrogen-fixing alpha-proteobacteria such as Rhizobium phaseoli (6 genes), Rhodopseudomonas palustris (4 genes), and Xanthobacter autotrophicus (4 genes), is the predominant source of characterized nitrogenase genes in current genomic databases, reflecting decades of genome sequencing focused on agriculturally important symbiotic and free-living diazotrophs. Eubacteriales (formerly Clostridiales) ranks second with 19 nifH/nifD genes from 8 organisms, including Clostridium pasteurianum DSM 525 (7 genes) as the dominant contributor, alongside other anaerobic nitrogen fixers such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum (3 genes) and Clostridium beijerinckii (2 genes). Burkholderiales has 11 genes from 5 organisms including the endophyte Herbaspirillum seropedicae, while Pseudomonadales has only 7 genes from 2 organisms, notably Azotobacter chroococcum. The dominance of Hyphomicrobiales (66 genes, 64% of the 103 genes in these four orders) reflects the extensive genome sequencing of alpha-proteobacterial diazotrophs and the multiple nifH/nifD paralogs retained in some of these organisms. Across the full NCBI Gene database, 375 nifH/nifD genes span 174 organisms, demonstrating that nitrogen fixation capability is phylogenetically scattered well beyond these four orders, including in diverse Archaea (e.g., Methanocaldococcus) and sulfate-reducing bacteria.
",True,8.81,"The correct answer is **Hyphomicrobiales**.

Hyphomicrobiales contains the highest number of nitrogenase structural genes (nifH and nifD) among these four bacterial orders.

The widespread occurrence of nitrogen fixation capability across multiple families within Hyphomicrobiales, particularly the agriculturally important rhizobia that have been extensively sequenced and studied, results in abundant representation of nif genes in genomic databases. While Burkholderiales also contains some nitrogen-fixing genera (such as *Burkholderia* and relatives), and certain members of Pseudomonadales possess nitrogen fixation capability, the diversity and number of diazotrophic species is considerably lower than in Hyphomicrobiales.

DSM 101043 (BacDive ID 131407) is documented to grow in Cyanobacteria Medium BG11-, which is a nitrogen-free medium used to induce heterocyst formation in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. A MediaDive query confirmed zero nitrogen-containing ingredients (no nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, or urea) in BG11-, establishing that the strain grows without any external fixed-nitrogen source. BG11- medium lacks fixed nitrogen sources, requiring nitrogen-fixing strains like Anabaena to form specialized heterocyst cells for atmospheric nitrogen fixation. This psychrophilic strain isolated from sediment can fix atmospheric nitrogen through the nitrogenase enzyme complex housed within heterocysts, specialized anaerobic cells that protect oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase from photosynthetic oxygen production. The cross-database integration between BacDive (strain characterization) and MediaDive (validated cultivation protocols) confirms this nitrogen-independent growth capability.
",True,7.02,"Anabaena sp. DSM 101043, like other members of the genus Anabaena, is a filamentous cyanobacterium capable of nitrogen fixation through specialized cells called heterocysts. This species can grow in nitrogen-free BG11- medium (also known as BG11₀ or BG11 without combined nitrogen sources) because it possesses the enzymatic machinery necessary for converting atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) into ammonia through the nitrogenase enzyme complex. When cultivated in medium lacking combined nitrogen sources such as nitrate or ammonium, Anabaena sp. DSM 101043 develops heterocysts, which are thick-walled cells that provide an anaerobic environment protecting the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase from inactivation while performing nitrogen fixation. This diazotrophic capability is a defining characteristic of Anabaena species and allows them to serve as model organisms for studying nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria.

The predominance of mupA in surveillance records reflects its plasmid-mediated transmissibility, which facilitates its spread among clinical MRSA lineages, whereas ileS mutations arise independently and are less common. The distinction between high-level (mupA) and low-level (ileS mutations) resistance has direct clinical implications, as high-level resistance compromises mupirocin use for MRSA decolonization regimens.
",True,9.65,"In Staphylococcus aureus, mupirocin resistance is associated with several AMR element symbols documented in genomic surveillance records. The primary resistance determinant is the mupA gene (also designated ileS2), which encodes an alternative isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase conferring high-level mupirocin resistance; this element typically accounts for the majority of mupirocin-resistant isolates in surveillance databases, with record counts often ranging from hundreds to thousands of entries depending on the specific surveillance system. The mupB gene represents another chromosomal mutation-based resistance mechanism, though it is less frequently documented with generally fewer isolate records. Low-level mupirocin resistance can result from point mutations in the native ileS gene encoding the wild-type isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, with these mutational variants appearing in variable numbers of isolate records. Some surveillance systems also document the mupR regulatory gene associated with the mup operon. The precise count of isolate records for each element varies significantly across different genomic surveillance databases (such as NCBI Pathogen Detection, CARD, or ResFinder databases) and changes over time as new sequences are added, but mupA consistently represents the most abundantly documented mupirocin resistance element in S. aureus with typical counts in the thousands, while other elements appear less frequently with counts ranging from dozens to hundreds of records.",365,308,0.005715,True,46.0,"Excellent.

Together with a 23S ribosomal RNA gene (1,040,576–1,043,484 bp) and a 5S ribosomal RNA gene (1,043,659–1,043,768 bp), the genome harbors four ribosomal RNA features in total. The spatial arrangement of the 23S and 5S rRNA genes adjacent to the first 16S copy suggests that these three form a classical prokaryotic rRNA operon (16S-23S-5S), while the second 16S copy at a distant locus may represent an incomplete or independent operon. The presence of multiple 16S rRNA gene copies is commonly associated with the capacity for faster ribosome production and more rapid adaptation to nutrient availability, as rRNA gene copy number correlates with maximum growth rate in bacteria. This structural information is retrievable directly from the INSDC nucleotide sequence record via the DDBJ RDF endpoint, with features linked to NCBI Taxonomy identifier 2527995 through the RO:in taxon relationship.

When distributed across eight GO cellular component subcategories using structured ontology IRIs, 49 of these proteins are annotated to the general proteasome complex (GO:0000502), while the 20S core complex (GO:0005839) accounts for 18 proteins, the accessory complex (GO:0022624) for 16, the core beta-subunit complex (GO:0019774) for 11, the regulatory particle base subcomplex (GO:0008540) for 9, the lid subcomplex (GO:0008541) for 8, the alpha-subunit complex (GO:0019773) for 8, and the 19S regulatory particle (GO:0005838) for 7. The sum of these category counts reaches 126 annotations for 52 uniquely annotated proteins (arithmetic verification: 126 > 52 = valid overlap), reflecting extensive multi-subcomplex co-annotation — for example, a beta subunit is simultaneously annotated to the general proteasome complex, the 20S core, and the beta-subunit complex. Four proteins lack the general GO:0000502 annotation entirely: PSMF1 (PI31 inhibitor), PSME4 (PA200 activator), PSB11 (inducible beta-11), and PSMA8 (testis-specific alpha-8). Three of them (PSMF1, PSB11, PSMA8) still appear in subcomplex categories (GO:0005839, GO:0019774, GO:0019773 respectively), while PSME4 carries none of the eight GO subcomplex annotations, consistent with its role as an externally docking activator rather than a structural subunit. Cross-referencing with ChEMBL reveals that 22 of the 53 proteins (41.5%) are registered as human single-protein drug targets, with all eight canonical beta subunits included — consistent with the clinical use of proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib that target the beta5 catalytic subunit (PSMB5).

Multi-subcomplex annotation overlap is relatively limited because most proteasome subunits are dedicated components of either the 20S core or 19S regulatory particle, though some regulatory proteins like PSME4/PA200 can associate with the 20S core independently of the 19S cap, and certain adaptor proteins may interact with multiple assemblies. Regarding therapeutic targeting, only a small fraction of proteasome proteins are represented as ChEMBL drug targets, primarily the catalytic β subunits (particularly β5, β1, and β2, along with their immunoproteasome counterparts β5i, β1i, and β2i), which are targeted by proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib used in cancer therapy, representing approximately 10-15% of the total proteasome protein complement.",381,419,0.007428,True,84.39,"Excellent!

The human proteasome protein landscape defined by UniProt keyword KW-0647 encompasses 53 reviewed proteins distributed across three major GO cellular component subcomplexes and associated regulatory factors. The 20S core complex, represented by GO:0019773 (alpha-subunit complex) and GO:0019774 (beta-subunit complex), contains 14 subunits comprising the seven distinct alpha-type (PSMA1-7) and seven beta-type subunits (PSMB1-7, including the immunoproteasome-specific variants PSMB8-10).

The accessory complex category (GO:0022624) comprises 20 proteins including proteasome activators (PA28α/β/γ, PA200), assembly chaperones (PSMG1-4, POMP), deubiquitinating enzymes (USP14, UCHL5), ubiquitin receptors (ADRM1, PSMD4), and adaptor proteins (ECM29, UBQLN1-4, RAD23A/B).

For the remaining 45 proteins, including ataxin-1 (ATXN1), ataxin-3 (ATXN3), CACNA1A, ITPR1, TBP, and PRKCG among others, their reviewed protein accessions are directly cross-referenced to MANE Select transcripts in Ensembl. The two exceptions arise from distinct annotation issues: for ATXN2, a MANE Select transcript (ENST00000673436) exists, but its encoded protein (ENSP00000500925) is cross-referenced only to an unreviewed TrEMBL accession (A0A5F9ZI57) rather than the canonical reviewed entry Q99700, reflecting an isoform-level discordance between the MANE Select transcript and the curated Swiss-Prot record; for ATXN8, the associated locus (ATXN8OS) is annotated as a non-coding RNA gene in Ensembl—its MANE Select transcript (ENST00000424524) lacks a translated protein with UniProt cross-reference, consistent with the fact that SCA8 pathogenesis involves a non-coding repeat expansion rather than a straightforward protein-coding gene.

MANE (Matched Annotation from NCBI and EBI) Select represents a collaborative effort to identify a single representative transcript per human protein-coding gene, but not all genes have MANE Select transcripts assigned, particularly those with complex splicing patterns, recent annotations, or uncertain primary isoforms. Spinocerebellar ataxia-associated proteins include various gene products involved in neurodegeneration, calcium signaling, RNA processing, and protein quality control pathways. The absence of MANE Select transcripts could occur for proteins encoded by genes with multiple complex isoforms where consensus on a primary transcript hasn't been established, genes with recent characterization, or loci with annotation challenges.

  - KCNT1","Among the four voltage-gated potassium channel genes KCNQ2, KCNQ3, KCNB1, and KCNT1 — all associated with MONDO-classified epilepsy syndromes — KCNQ2 (gene ID 3785, chromosome 20q13.33) has by far the greatest number of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in ClinVar, with 759 such variants, compared to 118 for KCNT1, and 102 each for KCNB1 and KCNQ3 (ClinVar January 2025 release; arithmetic verification: sum 1,081 > total distinct 1,077, indicating 4 variants attributed to multiple genes). This substantial variant burden reflects KCNQ2's role as the causal gene for both the severe DEE7 (developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 7, MONDO:0013387) and the milder benign familial neonatal convulsions type 1, making it a major target of clinical sequencing in pediatric epilepsy. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 encode the Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits that co-assemble to form the neuronal M-channel responsible for regulating neuronal excitability; KCNQ2 variants are more frequently pathogenic and more clinically diverse in severity than KCNQ3 variants, which mainly cause the milder BFNC2 (MONDO:0007366). KCNT1 encodes the sodium-activated KNa1.1 (SLACK) channel and causes the severe epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS, MONDO:0100025), while KCNB1 encodes the Kv2.1 delayed-rectifier channel associated with DEE34 (MONDO:0014718); both have a smaller but clinically significant variant spectrum compared to KCNQ2.
",True,7.09,"**KCNQ2**

KCNQ2 has the greatest number of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants documented in ClinVar among these four voltage-gated potassium channel genes. KCNQ2 is associated with a spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes including benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS) and KCNQ2-related developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, making it one of the most clinically significant and well-studied epilepsy genes. As the first gene identified for benign familial neonatal convulsions and a major cause of neonatal-onset epileptic encephalopathy, KCNQ2 has been extensively investigated through clinical genetic testing over more than two decades, resulting in the identification and classification of numerous pathogenic variants. While KCNQ3, KCNB1, and KCNT1 are also established epilepsy genes, they are associated with rarer phenotypes or were identified more recently, leading to fewer documented pathogenic variants in ClinVar. The high allelic heterogeneity and clinical recognition of KCNQ2-related disorders has driven more comprehensive variant documentation in clinical databases.",312,276,0.005076,True,34.74,"**KCNQ2**

KCNQ3 has 309 variants, KCNT1 has 337 variants, and KCNB1 has 243 variants. KCNQ2 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit critical for neuronal excitability regulation, and pathogenic variants in this gene are predominantly associated with neonatal-onset epilepsy syndromes including benign familial neonatal seizures and more severe epileptic encephalopathies.

In this reaction, two molecules of the lumazine intermediate undergo a dismutation: one is oxidized to release the four-carbon fragment that becomes the dimethylbenzene ring of riboflavin, while the other is reduced back to 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil, an earlier precursor in the riboflavin pathway. The reaction is chemically balanced, Approved in Rhea, and annotated with GO:0004746 (riboflavin synthase activity). The pteridine scaffold of the lumazine substrate is thus the direct biosynthetic precursor to the isoalloxazine ring system of riboflavin (vitamin B2).
",True,6.28,"6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine is classified in PubChem as a pteridine derivative, as it contains the pteridine ring system characteristic of CHEBI:17601. This compound serves as a substrate in Rhea-approved reactions catalyzed by riboflavin synthase (EC 2.5.1.9), specifically in the biosynthesis of riboflavin (vitamin B2). In the enzymatic reaction, two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine undergo a dismutation reaction catalyzed by riboflavin synthase, where one molecule donates a four-carbon unit to the other, resulting in the formation of one molecule of riboflavin and one molecule of 5-amino-6-(1-D-ribitylamino)uracil.

Let me verify one more detail - I need to confirm whether CHEBI:17601 in the user's question actually refers to pteridine itself or if it's supposed to be CHEBI:26373. Let me check what the user is actually asking about.

The user asked if the compound is classified as ""a pteridine (CHEBI:17601)"". From my findings:
- CHEBI:17601 = 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine (the compound in question)
- CHEBI:26373 = pteridines (the class)

So the user appears to have the wrong CHEBI ID for ""pteridine"" in their question. However, I found that:

1. **PubChem classification**: CID168989 is classified as CHEBI:17601 
2. **ChEBI hierarchy**: CHEBI:17601 has pteridines (CHEBI:26373) as an ancestor
3. **Rhea reaction**: RHEA:20772 contains 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine as a substrate, is Approved, and is catalyzed by EC 2.5.1.9 (riboflavin synthase)

No, 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine is not classified in PubChem as ""a pteridine (CHEBI:17601)"" because CHEBI:17601 is the identifier for 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine itself, not for the pteridine class. PubChem compound CID168989 is classified as CHEBI:17601, which means it is classified as itself. However, CHEBI:17601 is indeed a member of the pteridines class (CHEBI:26373), as pteridines appears in its ChEBI hierarchical classification. The compound is documented as a substrate in approved Rhea reaction RHEA:20772, which represents the conversion of two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine to riboflavin and 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil, and this reaction is correctly annotated with EC 2.5.1.9, the enzyme classification for riboflavin synthase.",26,2649,0.38951775,0.394537,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_pubchem_compound_id, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_compound_attributes_from_pubchem, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__ols__search, mcp__ols__fetch, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__ols__getAncestors, mcp__ols__fetch, mcp__ols__fetch",4,4,5,4,17,Correctly identifies compound as pteridine and Rhea substrate.

question_027,factoid,How many distinct approved biochemical reactions in the Rhea database are collectively annotated for the reviewed human enzymatic catalysts of the nicotinate metabolism pathway?,"The 22 reviewed human enzymatic catalysts of the Reactome nicotinate metabolism pathway are collectively annotated with 58 distinct approved reactions in the Rhea database. This repertoire encompasses the full biochemical breadth of these enzymes beyond their nicotinate-specific roles: the pathway itself covers the Preiss-Handler route (nicotinate → NaMN → deamido-NAD+ → NAD+ via NAPRT, NMNAT1-3, and NADSYN1), the NAD+ salvage route (nicotinamide → NMN → NAD+ via NAMPT and NMNATs), and NAD+ consumption and recycling steps (CD38/BST1 glycohydrolases, NNMT methyltransferase, NT5E nucleotidase). The per-enzyme Rhea contribution varies widely: the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SLC5A8 (Q8N695) links to 14 approved reactions reflecting its broad substrate range for short-chain carboxylates including nicotinate, while NT5E/CD73 (P21589) contributes 10 reactions covering all its nucleoside monophosphate substrates. CD38 (P28907) accounts for 6 reactions including NAD+ glycohydrolase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, and cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase activities. The 58-reaction total from 22 enzymes (68 protein-reaction pairs) reflects 10 shared reactions catalysed by multiple enzyme paralogues — for instance, the core NAD+ glycohydrolase reaction (Rhea:16301) is shared by both CD38 and BST1/CD157. In contrast, NAMPT, NADK, NAPRT, QPRT, and NNMT each contribute a single Rhea reaction reflecting their narrow substrate specificity, while NMNAT1 (Q9HAN9) contributes 2 approved reactions — covering both NMN (Rhea:21360) and NaMN (Rhea:22860) as substrates — consistent with its dual role in both the salvage and Preiss-Handler de novo routes to NAD+.

Together the eight genes harbor 7,800 distinct current ClinVar variants; BBS9 (1,283 variants) and BBS2 (1,258) carry the heaviest burdens, followed by BBS1 (1,193), BBS10 (1,007), BBS4 (900), BBS12 (868), BBS7 (849), and BBS5 (465, the lightest burden). By variant type, single nucleotide variants overwhelmingly dominate at 6,468 (83%), followed by deletions (666; 8.5%) and duplications (274; 3.5%). For clinical significance across all eight genes, the largest category is likely benign (2,808 variants), followed by variants of uncertain significance at 2,759, while pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and combined pathogenic/likely pathogenic entries total 1,638; 23 variants are counted in two BBS genes simultaneously, reflecting structural variants on chromosome 4 that overlap both BBS7 and BBS12.

The 98 specific ECs span primarily the four canonical glycosyltransferase sub-classes — hexosyltransferases (EC 2.4.1.x, the largest group), pentosyltransferases (EC 2.4.2.x), N-acylneuraminyltransferases (EC 2.4.3.x), and sialyltransferases (EC 2.4.99.x) — plus additional enzyme activities present in proteins tagged with KW-0328: an acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.286), a phosphotransferase/lipid metabolism enzyme (EC 2.7.8.15), and two glycoside hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.45 and EC 3.2.1.46). The 128 Rhea master reactions cover a broad range of sugar-transfer chemistries, including O-glycan and N-glycan elongation, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, proteoglycan assembly, GPI-anchor remodelling, ADP-ribosylation, and nucleotide-sugar metabolism, reflecting the diverse cellular roles of human glycosyltransferases in development, immunity, and signalling.

Across both lineages, the crystalline S-layer provides mechanical rigidity and selective permeability under the reductive, often high-temperature conditions of their ecological niches — anoxic sediments, rumen contents, hydrothermal vents, and deep-sea anaerobic environments — where peptidoglycan-based or outer-membrane-based cell walls would be thermodynamically or structurally disadvantaged.

This distribution was determined by cross-referencing the 141 reviewed human serine protease sequences from UniProt Swiss-Prot (keyword KW-0720, Homo sapiens) against all PDB entries via the UniProt accession links in the structure database. The total of 2,055 unique PDB entries spans five experimental techniques; two minor methods — ELECTRON CRYSTALLOGRAPHY (1 entry) and NEUTRON DIFFRACTION (1 entry) — also appear. The 2,056 method-level annotations for 2,055 unique entries indicate that one entry was deposited under two experimental methods (valid overlap). The overwhelming dominance of X-ray crystallography (91.5% of entries) reflects the historical tractability of serine proteases for crystal formation: their well-defined active-site geometry, availability of high-affinity inhibitor co-crystals, and pharmaceutical relevance as drug targets have driven decades of intensive crystallographic campaigns. Electron microscopy is still underrepresented for this family because most clinically relevant serine proteases are monomeric enzymes with molecular weights below ~100 kDa, at the lower end of optimal cryo-EM resolution, whereas solution NMR captures only the smaller members of the family.
",True,7.81,"X-RAY DIFFRACTION

X-ray diffraction (X-ray crystallography) accounts for the overwhelming majority of three-dimensional structure entries for reviewed human serine proteases in the Protein Data Bank. This technique has been the dominant method for determining serine protease structures since the first protease structures were solved in the 1970s, including landmark structures like thrombin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and numerous other medically important proteases involved in coagulation, complement activation, and digestion. The success of X-ray crystallography for serine proteases stems from their relatively small size (typically 25-35 kDa for the catalytic domain), their stability, and their amenability to crystallization, often facilitated by the use of specific inhibitors that stabilize particular conformations. While solution NMR has contributed some serine protease structures and provided valuable dynamics information, size limitations generally restrict NMR to smaller proteins or isolated domains. Electron microscopy, particularly cryo-EM, has revolutionized structural biology for large macromolecular complexes but is less commonly applied to the relatively small, well-crystallizing serine proteases, making its contribution to this protein family minimal compared to X-ray diffraction.",256,274,0.004878,True,92.05,"Perfect!

Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MONDO:0018868), a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by arylsulfatase A (ARSA) deficiency, is cross-referenced in MONDO to the MedGen concept C0023522 via the UMLS identifier. In MedGen's MGREL database, this concept has 47 documented ""manifestation_of"" relationships, one of which links it to Cholecystitis (MedGen:C0008325). While metachromatic leukodystrophy is primarily known for progressive neurological manifestations — including peripheral demyelination, cerebellar ataxia, and intellectual disability — gallbladder involvement, including Cholecystitis and gallbladder dysfunction, is documented in the structured clinical data. This reflects the systemic nature of sulfatide accumulation in MLD: ARSA normally degrades sulfatides in lysosomes throughout the body, and excess sulfatide deposits in gallbladder epithelial cells and bile ducts can lead to cholecystitis and gallbladder polyps. This association is catalogued in MedGen's clinical knowledge graph but is not prominent in the standard biomedical literature, making it non-trivially verifiable without querying current structured databases.

The disease primarily manifests with progressive neurological deterioration including motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, peripheral neuropathy, and demyelination. While gallbladder involvement has been reported in some lysosomal storage disorders, cholecystitis is not a recognized or commonly documented clinical manifestation of metachromatic leukodystrophy in standard medical literature.

question_038,choice,"Among the five Mus musculus limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs Capn3, Dysf, Lmna, Ano5, and Plec, which has the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts in Ensembl GRCm39?

Choose one of the following options:
  - Capn3
  - Dysf
  - Lmna
  - Ano5
  - Plec","Among the five Mus musculus limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs compared, Plec (encoding plectin, the mouse ortholog of the human LGMD2Q gene PLEC) has by far the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts in Ensembl GRCm39 with 21 isoforms, followed by Dysf (dysferlin, LGMD2B ortholog) with 12, Capn3 (calpain 3, LGMD2A ortholog) with 10, Lmna (lamin A, LGMD1B ortholog) with 4, and Ano5 (anoctamin 5, LGMD2L ortholog) with 3. Plec's exceptional transcript diversity reflects its unique genomic architecture: the mouse Plec gene encodes at least 11 alternative first exons (1a–1j and a common exon 2) that each splice into a shared downstream coding region, producing tissue-specific isoforms directed to distinct subcellular compartments — for example, isoform 1a targets hemidesmosomes in epithelia while isoform 1f localises to costameres and Z-discs in striated muscle. Dysf's 12 isoforms reflect alternative splicing of its tandem C2 domain array, relevant to its role in membrane repair at the sarcolemma. Capn3's 10 isoforms include the muscle-specific p94 form and lens isoform Lp82 arising from alternative promoter usage. By contrast, Lmna (4 isoforms, primarily lamin A and lamin C from alternative splicing at exon 10) and Ano5 (3 isoforms) are architecturally simpler. The striking isoform count difference between Plec and Ano5 (21 vs. 3) therefore does not reflect clinical severity but rather the mechanistic complexity of their membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding roles versus channel/lipid scramblase functions.
",True,6.3,"The correct answer is **Plec**.

Plec (Plectin) has the greatest number of protein-coding transcripts among these five limb-girdle muscular dystrophy gene orthologs in Ensembl GRCm39. Plectin is a large cytolinker protein that connects intermediate filaments to other cytoskeletal structures and cellular junctions, and its extensive alternative splicing reflects its diverse structural and functional roles across different tissues. The PLEC gene is known for generating numerous isoforms through alternative promoter usage and splicing, particularly in its N-terminal region, which allows tissue-specific expression patterns. This results in a significantly higher number of annotated protein-coding transcripts compared to Capn3 (calpain-3), Dysf (dysferlin), Lmna (lamin A/C), and Ano5 (anoctamin-5), which typically have fewer alternative transcripts despite also undergoing some degree of alternative splicing.",284,222,0.004182,True,79.85,"Perfect!

Ranked by co-annotation frequency, these genes and their ChEMBL targets are: SCN5A (2,768 articles; CHEMBL1980, Nav1.5), KCNH2 (935 articles; CHEMBL240, hERG), KCNQ1 (767 articles; CHEMBL1866, Kv7.1), CACNA1C (660 articles; CHEMBL1940, Cav1.2), and RYR2 (632 articles; CHEMBL4403, RyR2). SCN5A encodes the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 and is the primary causal gene for Brugada syndrome, responsible for 15–30% of cases through loss-of-function variants; its ChEMBL entry reflects its central role as a drug target for antiarrhythmic compounds and as a cardiac safety liability. The potassium channels KCNH2 (hERG) and KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) are prominent ChEMBL targets because inhibition of hERG is a major mechanism of drug-induced QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. CACNA1C encodes the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2, a target for dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. RYR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) is targeted by flecainide and other agents used in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, a related channelopathy with substantial overlap in the research literature. The complete overlap between the high-frequency co-annotation set and ChEMBL pharmacological targets reflects the ion-channel-centric pathophysiology of Brugada syndrome and the translational significance of these genes in cardiac drug development and safety pharmacology.

COX-2 has been the subject of intensive drug discovery efforts since the 1990s following the recognition that it is the inducible isoform primarily responsible for inflammatory prostaglandin production, while COX-1 performs more homeostatic functions. This led to the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) as a major class of anti-inflammatory drugs with reduced gastrointestinal side effects compared to non-selective NSAIDs. The pharmaceutical interest in COX-2 selectivity has resulted in extensive screening of compound libraries against this target, generating vast numbers of bioactivity measurements. While COX-1 is also well-studied as the target of traditional NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen, COX-2's role as a preferred therapeutic target for selective inhibition has driven more focused medicinal chemistry campaigns. The downstream synthases (Prostaglandin E synthase and Hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase) are more recently recognized drug targets with considerably fewer documented screening campaigns and bioactivity data points in public databases, despite growing interest in targeting terminal enzymes to achieve more selective modulation of specific prostaglandin pathways.",311,293,0.005328,True,111.63,"Perfect!

Of the eleven human siglec-family glycoproteins represented in GlyCosmos (SIGLEC5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16), these four are the only members for which site-resolved glycoproteomic mass spectrometry data have been curated: SIGLEC5 has 34 annotated glycosylation sites with 33 associated glycan structures (GlyConnect entry 568), SIGLEC7 has 32 sites with 31 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 569), SIGLEC8 has 28 sites with 27 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 570), and SIGLEC14 has 14 sites with 9 glycan compositions (GlyConnect 1978). The remaining seven siglecs (SIGLEC6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16) are recorded in GlyCosmos with glycosylation site predictions from GlyGen but lack curated per-site glycan composition data. Three of the four characterized siglecs (SIGLEC5, 7, 8) are CD33-related inhibitory receptors carrying cytoplasmic ITIMs, while SIGLEC14 is an activating receptor paired with DAP12; all four are expressed primarily on myeloid or NK cells and play roles in immune tolerance, allergy regulation, and innate immune modulation. Dense N-glycosylation of siglec ectodomains is biologically significant because the glycan shield can occlude the V-set sialic acid-binding domain, favoring cis-ligand masking on the cell surface over trans-ligand engagement, and modulating receptor clustering and signaling thresholds.

question_045,summary,"What are the structural characteristics of 3-demethylubiquinones as intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis, and how are they enzymatically converted to ubiquinones?","3-Demethylubiquinones are penultimate intermediates in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway that differ from their mature ubiquinone counterparts by a single structural feature: a free hydroxyl group (-OH) at ring position 3 instead of the methoxyl group (-OCH3) found in ubiquinones, classifying them ontologically as monohydroxy-1,4-benzoquinones within the broader ubiquinone family. This single substituent difference translates to a molecular mass difference of approximately 14 Da for each chain-length variant; for example, 3-demethylubiquinone-9 has the molecular formula C53H80O4 with a molecular weight of 781.2 Da (compared to 795.2 Da for ubiquinone-9), while 3-demethylubiquinone-10 has the formula C58H88O4 with a molecular weight of 849.3 Da (compared to 863.3 Da for coenzyme Q10). Their conversion to ubiquinones is catalyzed by SAM-dependent O-methyltransferases in a reaction where S-adenosyl-L-methionine donates a methyl group to the hydroxyl at position 3, yielding the corresponding ubiquinol (reduced) or ubiquinone (oxidized) product along with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. The Rhea database catalogues 7 approved reactions of this type, comprising 2 generic reactions covering the entire class of 3-demethylubiquinone and 3-demethylubiquinol species and 5 chain-length-specific reactions for the n=6, n=7, n=8, n=9, and n=10 polyprenyl variants that predominate across different organisms.
",True,9.9,"3-Demethylubiquinones are biosynthetic intermediates characterized by a benzoquinone ring structure with a polyisoprenoid tail, differing from ubiquinones by lacking a methyl group at the C3 position of the quinone ring while retaining methoxy groups at C5 and C6 and a methyl group at C2. These intermediates possess the full-length isoprenoid side chain (typically 6-10 isoprene units depending on the organism) but are incompletely modified at the benzoquinone head group. The enzymatic conversion to ubiquinones is catalyzed by the methyltransferase Coq3 (also known as UbiG in bacteria), which transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the C3 position of 3-demethylubiquinone, generating S-adenosylhomocysteine as a byproduct. This C-methylation reaction represents one of the final steps in ubiquinone biosynthesis, occurring after the hydroxylation and O-methylation reactions that establish the methoxy substituents. Coq3 is a membrane-associated protein that recognizes the benzoquinone substrate within the lipid bilayer and exhibits specificity for substrates with the characteristic polyisoprenoid tail. The methylation at C3 is essential for producing the fully functional ubiquinone that participates in electron transfer in the respiratory chain, as the methyl group influences both the redox potential and the positioning of ubiquinone within membrane protein complexes.",345,360,0.006435,True,94.74,"Now I have comprehensive information to answer the question. Let me synthesize this into a clear, complete answer.

3-Demethylubiquinones are quinone intermediates in ubiquinone biosynthesis that structurally possess a benzoquinone ring with a polyprenyl side chain at position 2 and a hydroxyl group at position 3 instead of the methoxy group found in fully synthesized ubiquinone. The biosynthetic pathway involves multiple O-methylation steps catalyzed by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases. According to data from Reactome and research retrieved from PubMed ([Hsu et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1021/bi9602932)), the COQ3 (or UbiG in bacteria) methyltransferase catalyzes the critical final O-methylation step, converting 3-demethylubiquinone to ubiquinone by transferring a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the C-3 hydroxyl position, producing S-adenosylhomocysteine and a proton as byproducts. This reaction follows hydroxylation of the dimethyl-ubiquinone precursor (DMQ10H2) by the COQ7:COQ9 complex, which introduces the hydroxyl group at position 3, generating the 3-demethylubiquinone intermediate (DeMQ10H2). Studies demonstrate that the COQ3 enzyme actually performs multiple methylation steps in the pathway: it first methylates 3,4-dihydroxy-5-polyprenylbenzoate (DHDB) to produce monohydroxy-demethylubiquinone (MHDB), while COQ5 methylates an earlier intermediate (MDMQ10H2) to produce the dimethyl form (DMQ10H2), and then COQ3 performs the final methylation of 3-demethylubiquinone to complete ubiquinone synthesis ([Hsu et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1021/bi9602932)). The 3-demethylubiquinone intermediates retain the lipophilic polyprenyl side chain that anchors them in membranes and the quinone ring structure capable of electron transfer, but lack the complete methylation pattern necessary for optimal function as the terminal electron carrier in the respiratory chain.",48,2925,0.6615339,0.667969,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__search_chembl_molecule, mcp__togomcp__get_pubchem_compound_id, mcp__togomcp__search_rhea_entity, mcp__togomcp__search_reactome_entity, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata, mcp__ols__search, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__ols__fetch, mcp__pubmed__search_articles, mcp__pubmed__get_article_metadata",3,3,4,4,14,"Describes structural features (benzoquinone ring, polyprenyl tail, C3 position).

The phosphorylated isoform designated p-T481,S486,S493-AXIN1 carries three co-occurring modifications: O-phospho-L-threonine at position 481 and O-phospho-L-serine at positions 486 and 493.

Mechanistically, the destruction complex—assembled by AXIN1 as scaffold, together with APC, CK1, and GSK3-beta—sequentially phosphorylates beta-catenin to mark it for proteasomal degradation; the phosphorylation of AXIN1 itself at T481, S486, and S493 enhances its stability within the complex and potentiates beta-catenin turnover, thereby maintaining the off-state of canonical Wnt signaling in the absence of Wnt ligand.
",True,7.53,"AXIN1, the key scaffold protein of the β-catenin destruction complex, is subject to multiple phosphorylation modifications that regulate its function in canonical Wnt signaling. The protein contains numerous serine and threonine residues that serve as phosphorylation sites, with casein kinase 1α (CK1α) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) being the primary kinases that phosphorylate AXIN1 within the destruction complex. Mass spectrometry studies and phosphoproteomic analyses have identified concurrent phosphorylation at multiple serine and threonine residues on AXIN1 in human cells, including sites in the regulatory domain and regions flanking the protein-protein interaction domains. Curated pathway databases such as Reactome, KEGG, and WikiPathways document AXIN1 phosphorylation events in their Wnt signaling pathway entries, with specific annotations of serine/threonine phosphorylation states that modulate AXIN1 stability, localization, and interaction with destruction complex components.

Per-genus breakdowns reveal a pronounced dissociation between culture-collection representation and taxonomic diversity: Chlorobium has the most BacDive strains (13 total, 10 with growth conditions) yet is recognized for only 8 NCBI species, whereas Prosthecochloris is the most species-rich genus in the family (19 NCBI-recognized species, largely owing to genome-based species proposals) but contributes only 3 BacDive strains of which 2 have growth-condition records. Chlorobaculum shows the highest cultivation success rate—all 6 of its BacDive strains are linked to MediaDive growth conditions—which reflects the early isolation and intensive characterization of its model organism Chlorobaculum tepidum alongside 5 additional species. Pelodictyon contributes 2 BacDive strains (1 with growth conditions) and 4 NCBI species, while Chloroherpeton is the most sparsely represented genus: a single BacDive strain with no MediaDive growth-condition record and only 1 NCBI species (monotypic). The per-genus sums are mutually exclusive and verified against family-wide totals: 13+6+3+2+1 = 25 total strains, 10+6+2+1+0 = 19 with growth conditions, and 8+6+19+4+1 = 38 NCBI-recognized species across all five genera.

question_050,choice,"Among Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which species has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records?

Choose one of the following options:
  - Klebsiella pneumoniae
  - Acinetobacter baumannii
  - Salmonella enterica
  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Salmonella enterica has the greatest number of distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records, with 23 distinct classes, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16), and Acinetobacter baumannii (14). The 28 total unique classes across all four species (sum of per-species counts = 75; 75 > 28, indicating 47 class-instances are shared, with core classes such as BETA-LACTAM, AMINOGLYCOSIDE, QUINOLONE, TETRACYCLINE, and SULFONAMIDE present in all four species) reflects extensive horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants among Gram-negative pathogens. Salmonella enterica's broader drug-class repertoire is consistent with its diverse ecological niches spanning human clinical, livestock, and environmental reservoirs, which expose bacterial populations to a wide range of selective antibiotic pressures and facilitate acquisition of resistance genes from taxonomically distant organisms; distinctive Salmonella classes include BLEOMYCIN, STREPTOTHRICIN, RIFAMYCIN, FOSFOMYCIN, and GLYCOPEPTIDE. Notably, this class-breadth ranking diverges from gene-symbol diversity: K. pneumoniae has substantially more distinct gene symbols in AMRPortal but a narrower class range than Salmonella by just one class, reflecting K. pneumoniae's depth in a few resistance mechanisms (especially BETA-LACTAM diversity via ESBLs and carbapenemases) rather than breadth across classes. Acinetobacter baumannii, despite its clinical reputation as extensively drug-resistant, shows the fewest distinct drug classes (14) among the four ESKAPE pathogens in current surveillance records, as its resistance phenotype is largely driven by a concentrated set of OXA-type carbapenemases and efflux pump mechanisms rather than broad class diversification.
",True,9.32,"**Klebsiella pneumoniae** is correct.

Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibits the greatest diversity of genotypic resistance mechanisms across distinct antibiotic drug classes in surveillance records. This species harbors resistance determinants spanning beta-lactams (including ESBLs, carbapenemases like KPC, NDM, OXA-48), aminoglycosides (various modifying enzymes), fluoroquinolones (qnr genes, gyrase/topoisomerase mutations), tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, macrolides, fosfomycin, and colistin (mcr genes). K. pneumoniae's remarkable capacity to acquire and maintain diverse resistance genes on mobile genetic elements, combined with its role as a major nosocomial pathogen, has led to extensive surveillance documentation of resistance mechanisms across virtually all clinically relevant antibiotic classes. While P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii are also highly resistant pathogens, their intrinsic resistance profiles and clinical treatment patterns result in surveillance focusing on somewhat fewer distinct drug classes. S. enterica, though capable of multidrug resistance, typically shows resistance across fewer antibiotic classes in surveillance data compared to K. pneumoniae, particularly regarding newer beta-lactam resistance mechanisms and the breadth of mobile resistance elements documented.",289,301,0.005382,True,39.34,"Perfect!

**Salmonella enterica**

Salmonella enterica has 24 distinct antibiotic drug classes represented in genotypic resistance surveillance records within the AMR Portal database, more than any of the other three species. Klebsiella pneumoniae follows closely with 22 distinct classes, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa has 16 and Acinetobacter baumannii has 14. This greater genetic diversity in resistance determinants for Salmonella enterica likely reflects its broad host range, extensive veterinary and food-associated surveillance, diverse ecological niches, and the accumulation of mobile genetic elements carrying resistance genes across multiple antibiotic classes including beta-lactams, quinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, and others.",17,887,0.2538644,0.259246,"mcp__togomcp__TogoMCP_Usage_Guide, mcp__togomcp__list_databases, mcp__togomcp__get_MIE_file, mcp__togomcp__run_sparql",1,3,5,4,13,Wrong answer (Klebsiella pneumoniae).
