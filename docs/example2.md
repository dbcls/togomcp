# Prompt
Determine the distribution of human enzymes by their EC number classes.

# Response
Charted enzyme classification strategy and database query approach.




I'll help you determine the distribution of human enzymes by their EC number classes. Let me query the relevant databases to get this information.

Get MIE file



Architected SPARQL query to categorize human enzymes by classification.




Now let me query UniProt to get human enzymes with their EC numbers:

T



Run sparql



Deciphered enzyme classification structure and devised aggregation strategy.

Good! Now let me query to get the count of enzymes by EC class:

T



Run sparql



Refined parsing strategy to accurately extract enzyme classification data.


Let me refine the query to properly extract EC classes:

T



Run sparql



Catalogued enzyme classes and computed distributional percentages comprehensively.



Perfect! Let me also get the total count and some specific examples for each class:

T



Run sparql



Synthesized enzyme data to visualize EC class distribution comprehensively.


Now let me create a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the distribution:

Synthesized enzyme classification data for distribution analysis.

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of human enzyme distribution by EC number classes using data from UniProt's Swiss-Prot database. Here are the key findings:

Summary
Analyzing 4,442 unique human enzymes, the distribution is:

EC 2 - Transferases: 1,823 proteins (41.0%) - Most abundant
EC 3 - Hydrolases: 1,655 proteins (37.3%) - Second most abundant
EC 1 - Oxidoreductases: 545 proteins (12.3%)
EC 4 - Lyases: 151 proteins (3.4%)
EC 5 - Isomerases: 148 proteins (3.3%)
EC 6 - Ligases: 124 proteins (2.8%)
EC 7 - Translocases: 103 proteins (2.3%)
Key Insights
Transferases and hydrolases dominate (78.3% combined), reflecting the importance of cellular signaling (kinases, phosphatases) and regulatory processes (proteases, lipases)
The abundance of transferases highlights sophisticated signaling networks essential for cell communication and regulation
The high number of hydrolases indicates complex systems for protein turnover, signal termination, and metabolic regulation
Smaller classes (EC 4-7) represent specialized but critical metabolic functions
I've provided a detailed report and visualization showing both the absolute counts and proportional distribution across all seven EC classes.
