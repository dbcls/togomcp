# Prompt
Find proteins that are associated with both cardiovascular diseases and have known small molecule inhibitors in ChEMBL, and classify them according to disease and drug availability.

# Response
Architected multi-database integration strategy for protein-disease-drug classification.






I'll help you find proteins associated with cardiovascular diseases that have known small molecule inhibitors in ChEMBL. Let me approach this systematically by querying multiple databases.

T



List databases



Charted strategy to cross-reference cardiovascular proteins with ChEMBL inhibitors.



Now let me search for cardiovascular disease-related proteins and their inhibitors. I'll start by querying for cardiovascular disease targets in ChEMBL and cross-reference with protein data.

Get MIE file



Architected comprehensive query to correlate cardiovascular targets with inhibitors.


Now let me query ChEMBL for cardiovascular disease-related molecules and their protein targets:

T



Run sparql



Excavated cardiovascular drug targets across multiple therapeutic classes.

Let me now search for more specific cardiovascular protein targets with known inhibitors by querying key drug classes:

T



Run sparql



Synthesized cardiovascular targets with inhibitors and disease classifications.

Now let me get more comprehensive data including disease associations and development phases:

T



Run sparql



Synthesized cardiovascular protein data and organized findings systematically.

Excellent! I've gathered comprehensive data. Now let me create a detailed classification document with all the findings:


Creating a comprehensive classification of cardiovascular disease-associated proteins with small molecule inhibitors
cardiovascular_proteins_inhibitors.md

Synthesized classification framework and devised reference summary table.

Now let me create a structured data table for easy reference:


Creating a CSV summary table of cardiovascular proteins with inhibitors



Architected visual classification framework and organized deliverables.

Now let me create a visual classification chart and move all files to the output directory:

Hypertension - 15+ validated targets with approved drugs
Coronary Artery Disease - 20+ targets (approved + developmental)
Heart Failure - 12+ validated targets
Cardiac Arrhythmias - 10+ targets with ion channel blockers
Pulmonary Hypertension - 6+ targets
Atherosclerosis - 12+ targets (lipid + anti-inflammatory)
Most Productive Target Families:

Sodium Channels: 57 inhibitors
L-Type Calcium Channels: 27 inhibitors
Beta-1 Adrenergic Receptor: 25+ inhibitors
ACE & AT1 Receptor: 17 inhibitors each
Ion Channels Overall: 60+ different protein subtypes
Drug Development Status:

✅ 50+ targets with approved drugs
🔬 15+ targets in Phase 3 clinical trials
❌ Several targets with failed clinical programs (CETP, Lp-PLA2, p38 MAPK)
Delivered Files:
Comprehensive Report (15 KB) - Detailed classification by disease with drug mechanisms, development status, and clinical insights
CSV Summary Table (4.8 KB) - Quick reference spreadsheet with all proteins, UniProt IDs, inhibitor counts, and approval status
Visual Classification Chart (18 KB) - Organized flowchart showing disease categories, target families, and validation levels
The analysis reveals that cardiovascular medicine has exceptionally well-validated protein targets, particularly in the RAAS system, adrenergic receptors, ion channels, and lipid metabolism pathways.
